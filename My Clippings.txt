One fortunate tendency of our times has been that which seeks to establish the supernatural life on the solid basis of dogma. Nothing is more right and necessary than this. Life ought to be based on truth; or rather, it is truth itself that descends, so to speak, from the heights of the understanding to pour itself out over the affections, the works, and all the activity of man.

2. La doctrina de Cristo excede a la de todos los Santos, y el que tuviese espíritu hallará en ella maná escondido. Mas acaece que muchos, aunque a menudo oigan el Evangelio, gustan poco de él, porque no tienen el espíritu de Cristo. El que quiera entender plenamente y saborear las palabras de Cristo, conviene que procure conformar con Él toda su vida.

humilde conocimiento de ti mismo es más cierto camino para Dios que escudriñar la profundidad de la ciencia. No es de culpar la ciencia, ni cualquier otro conocimiento de lo que, en sí considerado, es bueno y ordenado por Dios; mas siempre se ha de anteponer la buena conciencia y la vida virtuosa. Pero porque muchos estudian más para saber que para bien vivir, por eso yerran muchas veces, y poco o ningún fruto hacen.

Pero si alcanza lo que desea, siente luego pesadumbre por el remordimiento de la conciencia; porque siguió a su apetito, el cual nada aprovecha, para alcanzar la paz que busca. En resistir, pues, a las pasiones se halla la verdadera paz del corazón, y no en seguirlas.

11.- Cómo se debe adquirir la paz y del celo de aprovechar 1. Mucha paz tendríamos si en los dichos y hechos ajenos que no nos pertenecen no quisiésemos meternos. ¿Cómo puede estar en paz mucho tiempo el que se entremete en cuidados ajenos, y busca ocasiones exteriores, y dentro de sí poco o tarde se recoge? bienaventurados los sencillos, porque tendrán mucha paz.

¿Cuál fue la causa por que muchos de los Santos fueron tan perfectos y contemplativos? Porque estudiaron en mortificarse totalmente a todo deseo terreno; y por eso pudieron con lo íntimo del corazón allegarse a Dios y ocuparse libremente en sí mismos: Nosotros nos ocupamos mucho con nuestras pasiones; y tenemos demasiado cuidado de lo transitorio. Y también pocas veces vencemos un vicio perfectamente, ni nos alentamos para aprovechar cada día, y por esto nos quedamos tibios y aun fríos. 3. Si estuviésemos perfectamente muertos a nosotros mismos, y en lo interior desocupados, entonces podríamos gustar las cosas divinas y experimentar algo de la contemplación celestial. El impedimento mayor y total es qué no somos libres de nuestras inclinaciones y deseos, ni trabajamos por entrar en el camino perfecto de los Santos.

Y también cuando alguna adversidad se nos ofrece, muy presto nos desalentamos y nos volvemos a las consolaciones humanas. Si nos esforzásemos más en pelear como fuertes varones, veríamos sin duda la ayuda del Señor que viene desde el Cielo sobre nosotros. Porque dispuesto está a socorrer a los que pelean y esperan en su gracia, y nos procura ocasiones de pelear para que alcancemos victoria.

Del provecho de las adversidades 1. Bueno es que algunas veces nos sucedan cosas adversas y vengan contrariedades, porque suelen atraer al hombre a sí mismo, para que se conozca desterrado y no ponga su esperanza en cosa alguna del mundo. Bueno es que padezcamos a veces contradicciones y que sientan de nosotros mal e imperfectamente, aunque hagamos bien y tengamos buena intención. Estas cosas de ordinario ayudan a la humildad y nos defienden de la vanagloria. Porque entonces mejor buscamos a Dios por testigo interior, cuando por de fuera somos despreciados de los hombres, y no nos dan crédito.

El fuego prueba el hierro, y la tentación al hombre justo. Muchas veces no sabemos lo que podemos; mas la tentación descubre lo que somos. Debemos, pues, velar principalmente al venir la tentación; porque entonces más fácilmente es vencido el enemigo, cuando no le dejamos pasar de la puerta del alma y se le resiste al umbral luego que toca. Por lo cual dijo uno: Atajar al principio el mal procura; si llega a echar raíz, tarde se cura.

Para el que ama, para aquel en quien un amor profundo se ha enseñoreado de todo su ser, hay un temor que está por encima de todos los temores: la separación del amado; y este temor, dirigido por el Espíritu Santo, es precisamente lo que viene a constituir el don de Temor. El Espíritu Santo de tal manera nos une a Él, que nos infunde un horror instintivo, profundo, eficacísimo, de apartarnos de Dios, que nos hace decir: todo, menos apartarnos de Él; todo, menos perder nuestra unión estrechísima con el ser amado. Es un temor filial, es un temor nobilísimo, es un temor que brota de las entrañas mismas del amor; ese temor filial, perfecto y amoroso, es lo que viene a constituir el don de Temor de Dios.

Hay en la Escritura ciertas fórmulas desinteresadas, filiales, que expresan los sentimientos propios de un alma que está bajo el régimen del don de Piedad: «Gratias agimus tibi, Domine Deus Omnipotens, qui est, et qui eras et qui venturus es: quia accepisti virtutem tuam magnam et regnasti» (Te damos gracias, Señor Dios Omnipotente, que eres y que has sido y que vendrás, porque usaste de tu fuerza poderosísima y reinante)[10].

en cuanto a los actos que son propios de este don, en los referentes a las criaturas, en el primer grado del don, el alma se comunica generosamente a los demás. En el segundo grado ya no es la generosidad que da lo superfluo, sino la que da hasta lo necesario. ¿No recordamos una frase del apóstol san Pablo, frase extraña, frase audaz: «Yo desearía ser anatema por mis hermanos?». Como que llegaba el Apóstol a sentir el anhelo de perder los dones divinos para dárselos a los demás; ¡generosidad extraña!, ¡generosidad sin límites que procede del don de Piedad! El último grado de este don, particularmente en aquellas almas que están dedicadas a la vida apostólica, consiste en entregarse sin reserva, en darlo todo y en darse a sí mismas por los demás. El apóstol san Pablo experimentó maravillosamente este afecto del don de Piedad cuando dijo: «Ego libentissime impendam, et superimpendar ipse pro animabus vestris». (Yo daré con gusto todo y me gastaré a mí mismo por nuestras almas)[11].

The vertical relationship to God has, to some extent, been abandoned in favor of a horizontal relationship to man. Service is taking the place of prayer. The Mount of the Transfiguration is abandoned for the sake of the sick boy and the distraught father in the valley below. Marys are leaving the feet of Christ to become Marthas of the Inner City. The sacred is identified with the secular; the Kingdom of God becomes the Kingdom of Man. Jaroslav Pelikan describes the new science of spirituality as Trapeziology or the science of serving tables, which is the opposite of the message of the Twelve: “So the Twelve called the whole body of disciples together and said, ‘It would be a grave mistake for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait at table’” (Acts 6:2).

What Is the World? But what is the “world”? Biblically, it has two distinct meanings: the “world” may mean the earth or cosmos or creation as the theater of redemption, or the “world” may mean a “spirit” that organizes men, movements, social and political order without God. World 
as the theater 
of redemption  He was in the world… it owed its being to Him.  (John 1:10)  God loved the world so much that He gave His only Son, that everyone who has faith in Him may not die but have eternal life. (John 3:16)  And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations.  (Matthew 24:14)  This is in truth the Savior of the world.  (John 4:42)  Through Him, God chose to reconcile the whole universe to Himself.  (Colossians 1:20)  World 
as a spirit of worldliness, or 
the primacy of the ego over God  Men will love nothing but money and self; they will be arrogant, boastful and abusive; with no respect for parents, no gratitude, no piety, no natural affection… they will be men who put pleasure in the place of God, men who preserve the outward form of religion, but are a standing denial of its reality.  (2 Timothy 3:1-5)  Do not set your hearts on the godless world or anything in it. Anyone who loves the world is a stranger to the Father’s love. (1 John 2:15)  For the wisdom of this world is folly in God’s sight. (1 Corinthians 3:19)  Adapt yourselves no longer to the pattern of the present world. (Romans 12:2)

The ideal of spirituality is to be found in the first and last words of Our Lord’s public life. The first word of His public life was: “Come” (John 1:39; Mark 1:17; Matthew 4:18). The last word was: “Go” (John 20:21; Mark 16:20; Matthew 28:19). The disciple first comes to absorb His Truth, to become inflamed with His Love; then, and then only, he goes to accomplish his mission. Both words are summarized in Our Lord’s call of the disciples: “He called the men He wanted; and they went and joined Him.… These He would send out to proclaim the Gospel” (Mark 3:14). First, we become divinized in Him; then we secularize. Unfortunately today, we have too many “go-gos” and not enough “come-comes.” The proper balance is found again in the story of Martha and Mary which follows in the Gospel the Good Samaritan. In the latter, social service is praised. But in the story of Martha and Mary, it is suggested that we are not to become too absorbed in serving, that we have no time to sit at the feet of Jesus and learn His lessons.

Christ is really known only as a subject, as the husband and wife know one another in the marriage act. He is possessed and we are possessed, the distinction between lover and beloved is merged in love. We are not spectators looking at Christ on the stage. Some action on our part is necessary, even some cleansing of the windows of the soul, to let the light in. Then Christ does not appear as a Legislator, but as a Ferment. Before we sin, He appears as an Accuser; after sin He appears as our Intercessor. This is the opposite of Satan, who before sin appears as our Defender: “It’s not wrong; the Vatican Council changed all that.” After sin, the devil becomes our Accuser, as he is named in the Book of Job and in Revelation.

is not always true that we are happy because we love. Sometimes, the more we love, the more we suffer. A mother suffers more than a delinquent daughter who has lost all sense of virtue. Because God loves, He suffers for us.

Some priests and religious have love enough for the hungry, but not love enough to redeem from guilt. The priest, in order to relate himself better to the world, may preach a “social Christ” or a “political Christ” or a “revolutionary Christ,” but such indifference to the crucifixion produces sermons that are “sounding brass and clinking cymbals.” The intellectual and moral commitment of the priest to the Sermon on the Mount needs also the existential surrender to the prolongation of the Cross. Mother Teresa of Calcutta expressed this idea: “Serving the poor without the love of Christ crucified is social work.”

Dirty words have generally four letters, but the one word polite society shrinks from most is a five letter word: CROSS. The new schizophrenia in religion may be called staurophobia or “Fear of the Cross.” Christ has been torn apart from His Cross. Christ is on one side, the Cross is on another. Thus, we have a Cross-less Christ and a Christ-less Cross.

Here is the key to the priest-servanthood of Christ and that of all His priests. As priests we are to be holy. It is not our priesthood that commits us to the world; the priesthood binds us to the Father. As victims, however, we take the place of sinners by assuming their guilt and poverty and interceding for them. Like Christ, we come within the effects of sin because we are sinners by imputation. John the Baptist knows the holiness of Christ’s Priesthood: “Do you come to me?… I need rather to be baptized by you” (Matthew 3:14).

On the other hand, the poisoned were not told to make ointment, to minister to others, to fight the serpents, nor to make an offering to the serpent on the pole, nor to look at their wounds. Rather, what was here suggested was a figure and a foreshadowing of the manner in which the sinner would be saved; namely, by looking away from his own wounds to an appointed object of faith. This would be the Son of Man who must be lifted up. He would then be the brass serpent which looked like the serpent that stung the Israelites, but it had no venom in it. Christ on the Cross would look like a sinner, would appear as guilty, and yet there would be no guilt or sin in Him. The unlikeness would be His Priesthood; the likeness would be His Victimhood. It

have called Pietro Bernardone father, but now I am the servant of God. Not only the money but everything that can be called his, I will restore to my father, even the very clothes he has given me.’ And he rent off all his garments except one—and that one was a hair shirt. He piled his garments in a heap on the floor and tossed the money on top of them. He went out half naked in his hair shirt into the winter woods, walking the frozen ground between the frosty trees—a man without a father. He was penniless, he was parentless, he was to all appearances without a trade, or plan or hope in the world, and as he went under the frosty trees he burst suddenly into song. He made a fool of himself. It was a solid objective fact like the stones in the road that he made a fool of himself. He saw himself as an object very small and distinct like a fly walking on a clear window pane; and it was unmistakably a fool. And as he stared at the word ‘fool’ written in luminous letters before him, the word itself began to shine. He would go on being a fool; he would become more and more of a fool; he would become so foolish that he would devour fasting as a man devours food and plunge after poverty as madly as man digs after gold, and tear at his flesh as insanely as other men pamper it. In a word he—St. Francis of Assisi—would become the court fool of the King of Paradise

Added to identification with Him and helplessness, there had to be the note of vicariousness or a kind of substitution. In Russia there are a group of Christians who call themselves “Yurodivys” or “Born Fools.” When a punishment is about to be administered by a Communist guard, a yurodivy will ask that the stripes be given to him. His reasoning is: “The guilty will hate back, and thus the content of hate in the world will increase. Since I will forgive and absorb, the content of the world’s love will be increased.” Christ was the original yurodivy or “born fool” for He took our place, became our “stand-in” in order that we might be free. But to take our place He had to be sinless and He also had to be a willing victim;

Where does any priest learn mercy? From the deep consciousness that “God did not treat me as I deserve”! Where did I first learn condolence? From consoling another’s distress? No! It was from being consoled in my distress. My first lesson in transference is not from the good that I did to another, but the good that I receive. As the vocation to the priesthood starts with the holiness of God, so the priestly inspiration for transference is that Christ exchanged my sin for His love, and that is why I will become unprotected from the demands of others. In countless moments of the priestly life, the challenge of accessibility to others is hurled at me. The keeping of a visitor waiting, the delaying of the sick call, the sharp word to the “bum” at the door— all these are “transferees” awaiting a Christ-like response. My openness to others is the response-side of a hiddenness with Christ when in prayer I seek His spirit.

“Love is impaired by dread, more or less dimly felt by everyone, lest others see through our masks.

He does not use arguments, for in many cases those who lost the faith never did so for a reason. They left it for a thing. Souls generally do not fall away from Christ because of the Creed; they first have difficulty with the Commandments.

The Incarnation is not just something that happened; it is happening. What did it profit for the Son of Man to be born in Bethlehem unless He can be born today in the stable of my soul? As Augustine said: “God became man that man might become God-like.” The Word becoming flesh is a continuing thing; Bethlehem being the die by which we the coins are stamped. The Incarnation began with an angel asking a virgin if she would give God a human nature. A free choice inaugurated the “glorious liberty of the sons of God” (Romans 8:21). Would Mary be the means by which God would assume a human nature, so that He would be both God and man? He

Admitting unworthiness “proves that such transcendent power does not come from us, but is God’s alone” (2 Corinthians 4:7). “Shall the axe set itself up against the hewer or the saw claim mastery over the sawyer, as if a stick were to brandish him who wields it, or a staff of wood to wield one who is not wood?” (Isaiah 10:15).

There are two ways of abusing authority: one is to elevate oneself unduly over others; the other is to denigrate rightful authority. Peter warns against the first in the interesting version of Phillips: “You should aim not at being little tin gods but as examples of Christians living in the eyes of the flock committed to your charge” (2 Peter 5:3).

Thus, the authority of the priest can be abused in two ways: by intolerance and by tolerance. If power can be pressed unduly into arrogance, the absence of power, where men are entitled to expect it, becomes a damaging weakness. It used to be that the priest enjoyed prestige and general acceptance because of his function as an ambassador of the King of Kings. Today, because of a denial of authority, the ceding of preeminence of the spirit to the world, a priest often today has to earn respect. He does not enjoy status. Scandals have diminished respect for his authority. The task now is to re-earn it by personal fitness and repentance which restores the innocence that was lost.

Self is ever the obstacle that puts a barrier in the way of God, blocking the channels of His power. If there is anything that keeps a priest humble in the exercise of the kingly office of Christ, it is the remembrance of his own sins. The child is the model of humility because he is innocent; the priest becomes the model of humility when he knows he is not innocent. He is most strong in the affirmation of the authority of Christ when he is most conscious of his own weakness, for then command and compassion become inseparable.

As regards antipathy, I received a call from a Jewish art dealer who inquired if I would be interested in a hundred silver crucifixes. When I visited his shop, he told me he bought them from a community of nuns who decided not to wear a crucifix. “What’s wrong with your Church?” he asked. I spent an hour in answering his question, explaining our flight from the Cross. Some time later I received him into the Church, as on his deathbed he embraced the Crucifix which the Religious had abandoned.

Never in the Gospels is Christ without the Cross, never is the Cross without the Resurrection. But the tragedy of our day is the Great Divorce of Christ and the Cross. Picture Christ being torn from His Cross. To the right is Christ without the Cross; to the left is the Cross without Christ. Who picks up Christ without the Cross? Our Western affluent Christianity. We accept one of His mounts—the Beatitudes— but not the other—Golgotha. We mouth His teaching, sing hymns, and strum guitars and portray Him on the stage, but without the Cross: no self-denial, no doing of penance, no mention of sin or guilt for these create “abnormal psychoses,” no judgment, no hell, no nailing of the old Adam, no barriers and no repression.

The Passion of Christ prolongs itself consciously in all those who by an act of will join their frustrations, anxieties, fears, loneliness and sufferings to His Cross. “I have been crucified with Christ; the life I now live is not my life, but the life which Christ lives in me” (Galatians 2:20).

Since the Cross is the condition of salvation, he who suffers with faith need never ask what is required of him; nor need he spend time wondering whether his task might be somewhere else. If tribulation is the way, then to meet tribulation is a proof that one has not lost his way, but is on the right road.

the cross is no self-mutilation or masochism. It is a plucking off of dead buds that the new buds may blossom; it is the pruning of a tree for a richer harvest; it is the dull rehearsal for the triumph of a concert. God is not the God of dead things, but of renewed things. He does not change the Ideal to fit the way men live; but He changes the way men live to give them the Ideal.

In hearing the confessions of others, the priest sees more tombs emptied than those the first Easter sun lighted in Jerusalem. When he himself confesses, his spirit feels the sweet indifference that comes from faith. If I die, I shall be with Christ; if I live, Christ shall be with me. Life is adventurous. What difference does it make?

Only a priest is capable of a double betrayal: he can betray both Christ and the world. He betrays the world when he refuses to say a dialectical “No” to its spirit; he betrays Christ when he does not deal with the world’s sin. “Yes” to the world and its values is too often pronounced before a “No” to its anti-God. In early times, all the Church ever said to the world was “No”; today, too many of her spokesmen say only “Yes.” In truth, the “No” comes before “Yes” as the kenosis before the pleroma.

The Mass is the temporalization in time and localization in space of Calvary: (1) Every drama must be conceived in the mind of the author. (2) Then follows rehearsals and the choosing of characters and types. (3) Opening night. (4) The continuation of the drama through road companies. The Divine Plan of redemption reached back to the “Lamb that was slain… since the world was made” (Revelation 13:8). The rehearsal went through the Old Testament in such types as the sin-offering, scapegoat, paschal lamb and such characters as Moses, Jeremiah, Jonah, David, Job and others. The opening night was the Last Supper and Calvary. Finally, the prolonged and applied Calvary in the Mass: “From furthest east to furthest west My Name is great among the nations, says the Lord of Hosts.”

The Sacrifice of the Cross was bloody; the Sacrifice of the Mass is unbloody, though, as we shall show, there is a death and resurrection in both. What remains constant in both is that Christ is Priest-Victim. In all pagan religion and in the Jewish religion the priest offered something distinct and separate from himself: a bullock, a goat, a lamb. But Christ offered Himself. He was, therefore, Offerer and Offered. Every priest in a special way is both, and to some extent every Christian. Christ the Priest-Victim is in the offertory, the consecration and communion.

the chemicals in the earth and the sunlight could speak, they would say to the plants: “Unless you eat me, you will not have life in you.” If the grass and herbs could speak they would say to the animals: “Unless you eat me, you will not have life in you.” If the animals could speak, they would say to man: “Unless you eat me, you will not have life in you.” It would not be enough to say to the animal: “Look at the plant, see how it lives; let that be your example.” So Christ says to us: “Unless you eat My Flesh and drink My Blood you shall not have life in you” (John 6:54, 56). The lower is transformed into the higher; chemicals into plants, plants into animals, animals into man, and man into Christ.

Nature itself suggests death as the condition of life: If the plant could speak, it would say to the moisture: “Carbons and phosphates in the earth: you are chemicals. You have no life. Would you like to be lifted to a higher kingdom which is biological? If you would, you cannot be as you are in your present state. You must die to yourself, thus you can live in me.” If animals could speak, they would suggest to the plants that they could enter a higher form of life of seeing, hearing and locomotion. But they lay down a condition: “Not in your present state. You must be pulled up from the earth, ground beneath the jaws of death, and then only can you share my world.” Man offers a similar condition to animals: “Shed your blood, submit to fire; then you can live in a kingdom of thinking and love.” So Christ says to man: “If anyone wishes to be a follower of Mine, he must leave self behind; he must take up his cross and come with Me” (Matthew 16:24). Unless we die to ourselves we cannot live in His Kingdom. The Eucharist is precisely this: the proclamation not only of sharing His Life, but of sharing His Death. “For every time you eat this Bread and drink this Cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord, until He comes” (1 Corinthians 11:26). The Eucharist unites us to a sacrificial organism. The people of God are committed to sacrifice daily on the Cross. The dedicated body of each Christian is an organ, a cell or a member of that victimal Body of Christ.

Atheism is a melancholic reminder of our own unfulfilled Christian duties, and particularly our shrinking from the Cross. To preach about death as the condition of life is the essential theme of our day, if the Christian is to bring joy into the hearts of men. As in our cities, the graveyard has been separated from the Church, so the subject of death has been divorced from the pulpit. As we screen the Cross from the gaze of men, we shield them also from the Presence of Risen Life.

That is why the Mass properly understood is to be the focus of Christian living. Some say: “I get nothing out of the Mass.” True, but this is because they bring nothing to it. Any unwillingness to give up egotism, pride and lust means we bring no death to His death.

there is also guilt, sin, adultery, fornication, greed, hypocrisy which comes from inside the heart and spoils the world. Whose guilt is it? If we have the Christ-mind, it is ours— we priests are guilty: we bear the sins of many; we are numbered among the transgressors; we are called to His redemptive work.

Jesus being innocent, during the “Hour” allowed all the blasphemies of the world to stain His lips as if He had uttered them; all the thefts of the world were thrust into His hands as if He had committed them. Samson-like, He reaches up to pull down upon Himself all the sins of the world: Cain was there, purple in the sheet of his brother’s blood; the abominations of Sodom and Gomorrah were there; and present too were sins committed in the country that made all nature blush; sins committed in the city, in the city’s fetid atmosphere of sin; sins of the young for whom the Heart of Christ was so tenderly pierced; sins of the old who should have passed the age of sinning. Sin! Sin! Sin! until there pours out from the pores of His Body beads of blood, crimsoning the olive roots of Gethsemane in the first rosary of redemption.

How do we overcome the time and apathy that increase our neglect? By seizing a segment of time, an Hour, and redeeming the time (Ephesians 5:16). This is for the Lord, His Church and the world, not for me. Next, by strangling acedia or spiritual indifference and crowding it out with a new love. Our sloth can be overcome only by the expulsive power of a new affection. We cannot drive out vices; but we can crowd them out by a deepened love of Christ.

We priests are no “great shakes.” The Lord could find many others far more worthy. “We are no better than pots of earthenware to contain this treasure” (2 Corinthians 4:7). Paul was probably here alluding to the earthen pitchers in which Gideon’s army carried lamps (Judges 7:16). Much light inside, but you have to break them to let it out. “We are only human beings, no less mortal than you” (Acts 14:14). Even Elijah was “a man with human frailties like our own” (James 5:17). We know why God did not choose the wisest and most virtuous, that the glory might be His, not ours. If a Gallup Poll were ever taken, it would be discovered: “few are men of wisdom, by any human standard; few are powerful or highly born” (1 Corinthians 1:26).

To each priest, Christ says: “How shall I give you up?” A tender struggle goes on in the Sacred Heart between the opposite and contending claims of justice and mercy, and in the end mercy prevails. If Christ were not so merciful, our sin would not be so sinful. The deepest consolation for the unfaithful is that as Hosea took back his wife, so God takes back Israel; and Israel in turn would call God “Ishi” (my husband) (Hosea 3:16). “Go again and love a woman loved by another man, an adulteress, and love her as I, the Lord, love the Israelites” (Hosea 3:1). If Hosea can still love the wanton woman, will not God still love a guilty and thankless nation, aye! even a guilty and thankless priesthood? To each of us, He speaks as He did to the prophet, “I am God and not a man.” God is the Father of the prodigals;

The continuing love of Christ does not allow our present way of life to come to a full stop. He always is changing punctuation marks: He changes periods into commas. “Bartimaeus was blind.” “Lazarus was a beggar.” “Magdalene was a sinner.” “Naaman was a leper.” What seemed so final and conclusive that a period should be placed at the end of each life, by His Mercy is now changed into a comma. Bartimaeus was blind, but he saw; Naaman was a leper, but he was cured.

The priest does not belong to himself; he belongs to Christ. He need never worry who he is; he is not his own. He is Christ’s.

The ecstasy of the life of an ambassador is to so diminish his ego that the Person of Christ presides over his whole being.

In these days of conformism where the ideal of some religious and clergy is to be identified with the world, there is an increased incidence of psychic disorders. Some give themselves to Christ, saying, “I am not mine, I am thine,” and later they divorce Christ to make the spirit of the world the determinant of values. A terrific tension sets in which is buried in the subconscious by attacks against the Church or celibacy. A person who in the world was never lifted up to ambassadorship and intimacy with Christ can never guess the terrible torment of those who gave up this intimacy with the King. The secret of peace is the negation of the ego so that Christ may reign. As Simone Weil wrote: “We participate in the creation of the world by decreating ourselves.” We were made from nothing and as we get back to nothing, we touch God, for creation was ex nihilo. “As He grows greater, I must grow less” (John 3:30). No priest who understands his mission would ever say, “I gotta be me.” Rather, “I must be His.” The latter is not only better grammar; it is sounder theology.

What is a priest? A priest is one who makes Christ visible. The people see Christ in the saintly priest and they seek even to touch his robes as they did the robe of Christ. Children come to him without fear; non-Catholics give to him a reverence which they rarely give to others. The measure by which a priest draws souls to Christ is also the measure by which he can drive souls from Christ.

He, therefore, keeps in mind the gentleness of the Lord Who sent him. He will remember the Lord’s treatment of children as He put His arms around them (Matthew 19:14); His tenderness to the poor, sick, bereaved and penitent: “He will not break a bruised reed” (Isaiah 42:3); His soft speech: “He will not call out or lift His voice high, or make Himself heard in the open street” (Isaiah 42:2); His forbearance to His dim-witted disciples, especially to the impulsive, blundering and oft-times insolent Peter; the love of His Mother: nothing is more touching than, “Mother, there is your son” (John 19:26); His love of extravagant zeal: praising a woman because “it was her way of preparing Me for burial” (Matthew 26:13); His tenderness to laborers: “Come to Me, all whose work is hard, whose load is heavy, and I will give you relief” (Matthew 11:29).

When the Greeks came to Our Lord they said, “We wish to see Jesus.” This is the unspoken wish of every soul in crisis. The priest answers that question by making Christ available, “He is able to bear patiently with the ignorant and erring since he too is beset by weakness” (Hebrews 5:2). Glancing through the New Testament, courtesy is clearly the mark of the priest: “He must not be overbearing or shorttempered, he must be no drinker, no brawler, no money-grubber, but hospitable, right-minded, temperate, just, devout and self-controlled” (Titus 1:7-8).

But what has this to do with a Divine Sense of Humor? Do we not say that a person has a sense of humor if he can “see through things,” and do we not say that a person lacks a sense of humor if he cannot “see through things”? But God made the world according to such a plan that we were constantly to be “seeing through things” to Him, the Power, the Wisdom, the Beauty, and the Source of all that is. In other words, the material was to be a revelation of the spiritual; the human, the revelation of the Divine; the fleeting and the passing, the revelation of the Eternal.

The universe, according to His original plan, was transparent, like a window pane. According to that plan, a mountain was not just a mountain; a mountain was the revelation of the power of God. A sunset was not just a sunset; a sunset was the revelation of the beauty of God. A snowflake was not just a snowflake; a snowflake was the revelation of the purity of God. Everything told us something about God, for by the visible things of the world is the power and wisdom of the Invisible God made manifest. According to this plan, every man was a poet, for a poet is one who is endowed with this sense of the invisible, the power of seeing God through

priest is one who never complains about the particular duty of his state in life, for he knows full well that “all the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.” Why, then, should he who plays the part of a king glory in his tinsel crown and tin sword, and believe that he is better than someone else who plays a less important role in the great drama of life? For when the curtain goes down on the last day, and we respond to the curtain call of judgment, we will not be asked what part we played, but how well we played the part that was assigned to us.

Human nature everywhere, whether in the priesthood or out of it, makes one set plans, and either God or events or someone in authority negates them. Life, it seems, is like Sisyphus who pushes a stone up the mountain only to have it roll down again. If other persons do not contradict our hopes, some impersonal fate seems to do so. “An appointment in the slums which I loved at first, then cooled as I was passed over when ‘good’ suburban parishes were opened.” So the priesthood becomes a mixture of rising expectations and defeated hopes.

Men and women of God are not exempt from mental crises any more than anyone else. If the average number of mentally unbalanced in any population is 25 per cent, one can be sure that more than that percentage will be so afflicted in the religious life. But here we are not concerned with abnormalities that are independent of the clerical life, but only with one particular neurosis that develops from a failure to live up to one’s vocation. The universal tension in this area is between being attracted to the spirit of the world on one hand, and the Spirit of Christ on the other. A tension, a dialectic arises between what our priesthood demands and what our victimhood spurns. A civil war breaks out in our soul, and we lead a divided life, preaching one thing in the pulpit and denying it in the parlor. Even though there is a conflict, there is less reason for a priest going to a psychiatrist than anyone else, for he knows what provoked his divided heart, and he knows how to cure it, if he will pay the price.

Everyone in the world, to some degree, senses this “divided self,” the priest more than others, as we shall see. Literature and history are full of descriptions of the torn ego. Alphonse Daudet, in an autobiographical note, calls himself homo duplex! The consciousness that he was dual came to him first at the age of fourteen when his brother Henri died and his father wept. He says that his first self wept, but his second self said what a wonderful man of the theater he would be. From that time on, he realized that a horrible duality took over in his life, and the “second me” he was never able to put to sleep. From then on it was fit only for mocking. André

The more profoundly one has known Christ, the greater the anxiety in falling away from Him. Sometimes the anguish that follows any disintegration of personality is overcome for a time in various ways: (a) by “turning off” anything that would arouse it; e.g., avoiding a retreat, spiritual reading. This is what Scripture calls “hardening of the heart”; (b) by substituting activism to drown out the inner voice. This was the method of Peter who, refusing to pray, used a sword to hack off an ear; (c) by intellectually turning against the faith which is blamed for the inner disturbance.

Souls today are not sinners; they are patients. They have the psychic effects of sin, but are without forgiveness. Sin is not the worst thing in the world; the worst thing is the denial of sin. If I am blind and deny light, I shall never see; if I am deaf and deny sound, I shall never hear. If I am a sinner and deny sin, there is no forgiveness. The denial of sin is the unforgivable sin.

Our Blessed Lord was seen by John the Baptist, he said: “He takes away the sin of the world,” not sins. Sin here is regarded as a unit, a composite, that which stands in the way of man’s relationship to God. The sins that we enumerate in our confession with the number, the kind and the circumstance, represent enfringements of the law, particular violations, special categories of transgressions. It is the law that stresses the sins, and it is the Holy Spirit that emphasizes sin over and against the holiness of God. It is through such humiliation and through such a conviction of sin that the Holy Spirit gives access to a personal relationship with God, which is the true solution to guilt.

When I look at Jesus on the Cross, I see the story of my life. His Skin is the parchment; the nails the pen; His Blood the ink. In every thorn in that Head I see my pride, my boastings, my superiority complex. In the pierced Feet I read the many times as a lost sheep I wandered among briars from the sheepfold. In His riven Hands I see recounted my greed, my creature-comfort, my incessant reaching out for “more.” In His Flesh hanging from Him like purple rags, I see my lust and impurities. In the bruised Lips I read the words of consecration so quickly murmured, and in the whole Body I relive all my failings in the mystery: “This is My Body! This is My Blood!”

This new one would not be of earth, but of flesh; it would be a Garden over whose portals the name of sin would never be written—a Garden in which there would grow no weeds of rebellion to choke the growth of the flowers of grace—a Garden from which there would flow four rivers of redemption to the four corners of the earth—a Garden so pure that the Heavenly Father would not blush at sending His Own Son into it—and this “flesh-girt Paradise to be gardened by the Adam new” was Our Blessed Mother.

I never could see why anyone in this day and age should object to the Immaculate Conception; all modern pagans believe that they are immaculately conceived. If there is no original sin, then everyone is immaculately conceived. Why do they shrink from allowing to Mary what they attribute to themselves? The doctrine of Original Sin and the Immaculate Conception are mutually exclusive. If Mary alone is THE Immaculate Conception, then the rest of us must have Original Sin.

She is the one whom every man loves when he loves a woman—whether he knows it or not. She is what every woman wants to be when she looks at herself. She is the woman whom every man marries in ideal when he takes a spouse; she is hidden as an ideal in the discontent of every woman with the carnal aggressiveness of man; she is the secret desire every woman has to be honored and fostered; she is the way every woman wants to command respect and love because of the beauty of her goodness of body and soul. And this blueprint love, whom God loved before the world was made; this dream woman before women were, is the one of whom every heart can say in its depth of depths: “She is the Woman I love!”

Sanctity is made from conflict. Since every action calls for a corresponding reaction, the strong sensual libido of the spiritually minded person produces greater spirituality. Life is something like Jacob who had to struggle and wrestle to win favor with God. No one is crowned unless he has struggled (2 Timothy 2:5).

When her Son was taken down from the Cross and laid in her arms as a paten and drained chalice, she could say the words of consecration as no priest can say them: “This is my Body; This is my Blood. No one in all the world gave Him body and blood but me.” Because she gave Him a human nature, He was passible and, therefore, Victim. But because she generated the Son of God, He was Holy and, therefore, Priest. She is therefore in a special way the protectress of the priesthood, especially in the area of freedom.

One finds superiority, too, in the justification of love. A man always gives reasons for loving. He loves her because of her hair, the way she wrinkles her nose, the cuteness of her baby talk, the brilliance of her conversation, her radiant loveliness. A woman does not give reasons; she just loves. Love for her cannot be torn apart, analyzed and dissected. Love is a “whole piece.”

Celibacy has been turned upside down in our times. We chose Christ with limitations; we gave ourselves as priests, but we insert a lot of fine print in the contract in the hope that He does not read it and we can escape victimhood. We lay down conditions: caveat emptor; let the Divine Buyer beware. We hide a lot of gimmicks in our ordination. Maybe someone “prettier” than a purpureal robed Christ will come along some day. How do I know what I will do in the face of that loneliness? (Though we must say that the choices of those who break their vows are in some instances poor remedia concupiscientiae.) The skeptical has choked the spiritual life as the Philistines choked the wells of Abraham in the valley of Gerar long ago, but we find, as Isaac did, that the underground wells are still there, buried but undestroyed. As Julian Huxley wrote: “the blank space in the modern heart is a God-shaped blank.” Celibacy is not the renouncing of a person outside us, but the concentration on a Person inside. Celibacy is not the renouncing of love; it is the resolution to love as Christ loves. If celibacy is a loneliness (and indeed it is), it is the loneliness of the Virgin’s womb in which the Word is conceived. Silence is not the absence of words, but the presence of an invitation and encounter. Marriage and celibacy are both signs of God; marriage is the penultimate because it goes to love of God through human love; celibacy is the ultimate. In

El Espíritu Santo es de Dios, es Dios, pero cuando se nos ha dado es nuestro. Y es nuestro —dice el Santo Doctor— como puede ser nuestra una cosa de la cual podemos con libertad disponer; así, nosotros podemos con libertad disponer de este Espíritu que ha venido a ser nuestro, es decir, podemos gozar de Él cuando queramos, porque lo poseemos, porque nos pertenece, porque está a nuestra disposición.

Cuando tenemos algo nuestro, a la hora que nos place podemos disponer de aquello; no así si es una cosa ajena que se nos prestó; solo podemos entonces usar de ella mientras lo quiera su dueño o mientras la prudencia aconseje que de ella usemos; en tanto que de lo nuestro disponemos con toda nuestra libertad y siempre que queramos.

Christian life is the reproduction of Jesus in souls; and perfection, the most faithful and perfect reproduction, consists in the transformation of souls into Jesus. This is the doctrine of St. Paul, set forth time and again in his letters: “Do you not know . . . that Christ Jesus is in you?”; 8 “All you who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ”; 9 “. . . Christ dwelling through faith in your hearts”; 10 “Those whom He has foreknown He has also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son.” 11 These are some of the apostle’s many expressions relative to Christian life.

the action of the Holy Spirit and the cooperation of the most holy Virgin Mary are constant; without them, not one single character of Jesus would be traced on our souls, no virtue would grow, no gift would be developed, no grace would increase, no bond of union with God would be strengthened in the rich flowering of the spiritual life.

To the Artist of souls, sanctification and possession are the same act, for sanctification is the work of love, and love is possession. The very lowest degree of sanctity demands that the Holy Spirit dwell in our souls and possess them, while supreme sanctity is the supreme possession that the Spirit attains in the soul, the full and perfect possession of love.

Some think that in order to consecrate themselves to the Holy Spirit, it is enough for them to recite devoutly some prescribed prayer. The prayer may be beautiful and meaningful, but the wealth of thought and beauty it embodies will often remain unrealized; its influence will be only ephemeral and transitory. It is a good and holy thing to say the prayer, provided it is said, not as a mere formula, but as a sincere expression of the promises we intend to fulfill during our whole life — provided it is truly the beginning of a new life.

When a temple is consecrated to God, it is a place set apart for Him alone. The greatest possible purity and solidity, the truest art, are used in its construction; and after it is magnificently ornamented, it is offered to God, to be His forever. All around the temple is the land that belongs to the children of men. The temple is the gate of Heaven, the house of God; outside it, one can do all that is lawful; within, one can only give glory to God.

True devotion to the Holy Spirit, therefore, is not something superficial and intermittent, but something profound and constant, like Christian life itself; it is the love of the soul that corresponds to the love of God, the gift of the creature who tries to be grateful for the divine Gift, the human cooperation that receives the loving and efficacious action of God. As divine love is eternal, its gift without repentance and its action constant, it is our part to have our heart always open to love, ready to receive the unspeakable gift, and to keep all our powers docile to the divine movement.

Razón tenía el gran amador de Jesucristo, San Pablo, al afirmar: “El amor de Cristo nos apremia” (II Cor. 5, 14), que equivalía a decir que le obligaba y como forzaba más a amar a Jesucristo, no tanto por lo que por él había padecido, cuanto el amor con que lo había sufrido.

«Saber que Jesucristo, verdadero eterno Dios omnipotente, nos ha amado hasta querer sufrir por nosotros muerte de cruz, ¿no es sentir como prensados nuestros corazones y apretados fuertemente, para exprimir de ellos el amor con una violencia que cuanto es más fuerte es tanto más deleitosa?». Y prosigue: «¿Por qué no nos abrazamos en espíritu a Él, para acompañarle en la muerte de cruz, ya que en ella quiso morir por nuestro amor?... Un mismo fuego consumirá al Creador y a su miserable criatura; mi Jesús es todo mío y yo todo suyo. Viviré y moriré sobre su pecho, y ni la muerte ni la vida serán poderosas para separarme de Él. ¡Oh amor eterno!, mi alma os busca y os elige para siempre. Venid, Espíritu Santo, e inflamad nuestros corazones en vuestro amor. ¡O amar o morir! ¡Morir y amar! Morir a todo otro amor para vivir en el de Jesús y así no morir eternamente, y viviendo en nuestro amor eterno, ¡oh Salvador de las almas!, cantaremos eternamente: ¡Viva Jesús! ¡Yo amo a Jesús! ¡Viva Jesús, a quien amo! ¡Yo amo a Jesús, que vive y reina por los siglos de los siglos! Amén».

felicidad es altruista, juega al escondite, se oculta cuando la buscamos con egoísmo. Pero nos sale al encuentro cuando, sin mirarnos a nosotros, nos abrazamos con lo más noble: el deber, la virtud, el bien del prójimo, Dios. Un día de buscar nuestro gusto o capricho, deja un vacío profundo. Otro día de sacrificarnos por el prójimo o por Dios, produce plenitud de satisfacción.

El presente con pensamientos alegres es un camino placentero (a pesar de zarzas y espinas) que lleva a la felicidad, pero pasando por entre dos abismos: el "pasado" y el "futuro". Quien, por la tristeza, añoranza, resentimientos o escrúpulos, cae en el pasado" o se hunde por la preocupación en el "porvenir" deja de avanzar hacia su felicidad. Claro que a veces hay que prever el futuro, hay que preocuparse de él. Pero que sea tanto cuanto nos lleve a la decisión y nada más. Previa ocupación serena, sí; preocupación angustiosa, jamás.

Basamos la reeducación de la mente en la distinción entre receptividad y emisividad de nuestro mundo psíquico, y en el axioma de que simultáneamente no podemos ser plenamente receptores y emisores; estar fotografiando un objeto y proyectándolo al mismo tiempo. Si nos damos cuenta exacta de lo que vemos u oímos, no podemos al mismo tiempo pensar en si lo hacemos bien, o en lo que nos entristece o atemoriza. Y, al revés, si pensamos en la injuria o peligro dejamos de darnos cuenta nítida de los colores y sonidos.

REEDUCACIÓN MÁS PSÍQUICA La falta de interés por lo que leemos, oímos o hacemos, o la mayor repulsión, atractivo o importancia que concedemos a lo que deseamos o tememos, son los mayores enemigos de la concentración. Las fobias o ideas parásitas, las preocupaciones o pasiones desenfrenadas, son las que más distracciones causan. El remedio consiste ante todo en descubrir ese foco perturbador, y en debilitarlo y aun destruirlo, como explicaremos más adelante. Al mismo tiempo hay que suscitar el interés y gusto por lo que estudiamos o hacemos, viendo su utilidad, conveniencia y aun facilidad. Y mejor aún, verlo a la luz y al calor del ideal, lo que suscitará el entusiasmo

"Por este método vencí la impaciencia en el trato con una persona muy poco simpática.

Así que no son los acontecimientos los que causan nuestra ira, temor o tristeza, sino el pensamiento que en nosotros se suscita y que no dominamos; y por la misma razón no son los sucesos prósperos o adversos los que causan nuestra felicidad o desdicha, sino nuestras ideas. Si tenemos pensamientos alegres, seremos felices aun en medio del dolor: los mártires los tenían y cantaban alegres en los tormentos. Si los tenemos tristes seremos desgraciados aun nadando en la abundancia, como aquellos 80 millonarios suicidas en un solo año.

Se producen al ver que la dicha se nos afianza por el desarrollo y utilización de las cualidades recibidas, al ver en los acontecimientos más bien su aspecto favorable y aún más, por nuestra decisión de superar los desfavorables. Produce, sobre todo, paz, seguridad y confianza, el convencimiento de que la Bondad Omnipotente se ocupa de mí, gobernando todos los acontecimientos y dirigiéndolos para mi bien verdadero y duradero. La frase de san Pablo "Todo lo puedo en Aquel que me conforta" ha dado valor a muchísimos creyentes. Si El que todo lo puede, me ama y se comprometió con juramento, a darme cuanto de El confío, puedo estar seguro de conseguir cuanto me conviene: vencer mis fobias y superar los obstáculos de mi felicidad, con tal de poner lo que está de mi parte y esperarlo firmemente de El.

«Cuando el amor de Dios se apodera del alma, engendra en ella insaciable deseo de trabajar por el amado, de tal manera que, por muchas y grandes obras que haga y por mucho tiempo que emplee en su servicio, todo le parece nada y anda siempre gimiendo y suspirando de hacer tan poco por Dios; y si en su mano estuviera dar la vida por Él, aún no tendría cumplido gozo. De donde resulta que siempre se considera inútil en cuanto obra, porque el amor, enseñándole, por una parte, cuánto merece Dios, le declara por otra, con clarísima luz, cuán defectuosas son sus obras, todo lo cual es para ella confusión y quebranto, al conocer la bajeza y poco valer de sus acciones ante la majestad de Señor tan poderoso».

Los maestros de la vida espiritual nos describen los caracteres del verdadero amor, y dicen que el amor es temeroso, porque lo único que teme es desagradar a Dios; es generoso, porque, puesta su confianza en Dios, se lanza a empresas a mayor gloria de Dios; es fuerte, porque vence los desordenados apetitos, y aun en medio de las más violentas tentaciones, sale siempre triunfador; es obediente, porque a la menor inspiración se inclina a cumplir la divina inspiración; es puro, porque sólo tiene a Dios por objeto, y le ama porque merece ser amado; es ardoroso, porque quisiera encender en todos los corazones el fuego del amor y verlos abrasados en divina caridad; es embriagador, porque hace andar al alma fuera de sí, como si no viera ni sintiera, ni tuviera sentidos para las cosas terrenas, pensando sólo en amar a Dios; es unitivo, porque logra unir con apretado lazo de amor la voluntad de la criatura con la del Creador; es suspirante, porque vive el alma llena de deseos de abandonar este destierro para volar a unirse perfectamente con Dios en la patria bienaventurada, para allí amarle con todas sus fuerzas.

Estas cosas a que se refería era que permaneciesen en su amor por la observancia de sus mandamientos, esto es, que procurasen la gloria de Dios. Y a esto llama Jesús su gozo. Este gozo de Jesús, que es la gloria de Dios, debe estar en ellos para que su gozo, es decir, su satisfacción sea completa, plenamente verdadera.

La gloria de Dios y la felicidad del hombre son dos páginas de la misma hoja de un libro, siendo la una continuación de la otra; preciso es no separarlas ni trastrocarlas, so pena de hacer perder su sentido al libro de la creación. Por tanto, subordinación y coordinación del interés humano al interés divino; Dios el primero, yo el segundo; la gloria de Dios ante todo, mi satisfacción después de ella, sometida a ella, conforme a ella: he aquí la primera parte del plan divino.

Estos tres amores se funden en un solo amor, porque en los tres es siempre la gloria única de Dios lo que se procura. ¡Que Dios me haga la gracia de vivir y de hacer vivir para Él según toda la extensión de las obligaciones y de las posibilidades de mi vocación! Digo bien “de mi vocación”, porque conforme a ella es como debo glorificar a Dios, en mí y alrededor de mí. Toda vocación tiene una responsabilidad, y esta responsabilidad debe efectuarse y cumplirse para honra de Dios.

Vanidad es, pues, buscar riquezas perecederas y esperar en ellas. También es vanidad desear honras y ensalzarse vanamente. Vanidad es seguir el apetito de la carne y desear aquello por donde después te sea necesario ser castigado gravemente. Vanidad es desear larga vida y no cuidar que sea buena. Vanidad es mirar solamente a esta presente vida y no prever lo venidero. Vanidad es amar lo que tan presto se pasó: y no buscar con solicitud el gozo perdurable

De cualquier manera que se presente, la consecuencia es siempre el rechazo de la comunión, la negación de su existencia, la negativa a relacionarse con Dios prácticamente. Se podrá seguir hablando de Dios y hasta ocuparse intensamente con su idea. Pero por más que se hable de Él ya no se habla con Él. Dios se ha convertido en un tema, en un objeto. Ha dejado de ser una presencia, un Tú. Pero sobre todo ha dejado de ser alguien cuya acción se percibe, se tiene en cuenta y se acata.

“El pensamiento de nuestro tiempo se caracteriza porque [...] por una parte busca preservar la idea de lo divino como si ella fuera la auténtica preocupación de la religión, y por otra, destruye la realidad que sustenta la idea de Dios y, en esa forma, destruye también la realidad de nuestra relación con él. Esto se lleva a cabo de muchas maneras, abierta y encubiertamente, apodíctica e hipotéticamente, en el lenguaje de la metafísica (Kant, Hegel) y en el de la psicología (Jung)” [...]”Muchos verdaderos creyentes saben cómo hablar a Dios, con Dios, mas no sobre Dios o acerca de Él” [...] “Es la situación del hombre que ya no experimenta la presencia de lo divino frente a él. No importa que no se atreva o que sea incapaz de experimentarla. Puesto que se ha alejado de esa presencia existencialmente, ya no la conoce como algo frente a él” 24

Pero muchas veces tenemos algo adentro escondido, o de fuera se ofrece, en cuya afición nos lleva tras sí. Muchos buscan secretamente su propia comodidad en las obras que hacen, y no se dan cuenta. También les parece estar en buena paz cuando se hacen las cosas a su voluntad y gusto; mas si de otra manera suceden, presto se alteran y entristecen.

Cosa, por cierto, muy de alabar en todos los superiores, que deben ser suaves y benignos con sus súbditos y, cuando tienen que señalar una ocupación, deben más bien rogar que mandar. Decía San Vicente de Paúl: «No hallarán los superiores mejor modo de ser obedecidos que mediante la afabilidad». Y de igual manera se expresaba Santa Juana de Chantal: «Experimenté varios modos de gobernar a mis súbditos, y no lo hallé mejor que la suavidad y tolerancia».

Esto reza con las personas que quizás se inquietan cuando la caridad o la obediencia las obliga a dejar sus acostumbradas devociones; estén persuadidas de que tal inquietud no proviene de Dios, sino que es cosa del demonio o del amor propio. Dese gusto a Dios, aunque en ello vaya la muerte: era la primera máxima de los santos.

Según es nuestro propósito, así es nuestro aprovechamiento; y quien quiere aprovecharse bien, ha menester ser muy diligente. Si el que propone firmemente falta muchas veces, ¿qué será el que tarde o nunca propone? Acaece de diversos modos el dejar nuestro propósito; y faltar de ligero en los ejercicios acostumbrados no pasa sin algún daño. El propósito de los justos más pende de la gracia de Dios que del saber propio; en el confían siempre y en cualquier cosa que comienzan. Porque el hombre propone, pero Dios dispone; y no está en mano del hombre su camino (Prov 16, 9; Jer 10, 23).

Las virtudes teologales pueden languidecer en el alma del apóstol, cuando éste se pone a sí mismo o se busca a sí mismo en la acción apostólica, olvidándose de la gracia-eficaz para confiar en la eficacia de su acción propia; o lo que es más grave, desviando la acción apostólica de sus fines últimos hacia sus propios fines.

Dijo uno: Cuantas veces estuve entre los hombres volví menos hombre. Lo cual experimentamos cada día cuando hablamos mucho. Más fácil cosa es callar siempre que hablar sin errar. Más fácil es encerrarse en su casa que guardarse del todo fuera de ella. Por esto, al que quiere llegar a las cosas interiores y espirituales le conviene apartarse con Jesús de la gente. Ninguno se muestra seguro en público, sino el que se esconde voluntariamente. Ninguno habla con acierto, sino el que calla de buena gana. Ninguno preside dignamente, sino el que se sujeta con gusto. Ninguno manda con razón, sino el que aprendió a obedecer sin replicar.

hasta los pecados, pues también los pecados cometidos pueden cooperar a nuestra santificación, en cuanto su recuerdo nos hace más humildes y agradecidos, a vista de los favores que Dios nos otorga, después de haberle ofendido tanto. Yo nada puedo, debe decir el pecador, nada merezco más que el infierno, pero he de tratar con un Dios de infinita bondad, que tiene empeñada la palabra de oír a todo el que le pidiere. Pues que me libró de la eterna condenación y quiere ahora que sea santo, ofreciéndome para ello su ayuda, bien puedo llegar a serlo, no ciertamente con mis fuerzas, sino con el favor de Dios, que me conforta: “Para todo siento fuerzas en aquel que me conforta” (Phil. 4, 13).

Dice el profeta Ageo que quienes trabajan, mas no para complacer a Dios, ponen sus ganancias en saco roto, que cuando se abre no se halla nada. Y de ello proviene que estos tales, si después de tanto trabajo no alcanzan el apetecido resultado, se desaniman; prueba de que no tenían por finalidad la sola gloria de Dios: quien obra sólo por esa divina gloria, aunque no tenga el apetecido éxito, no se turba, pues al fin logró el fin que se prefijara, que era agradar a Dios por medio de su rectitud de intención.

He aquí algunas señales para conocer si en los ministerios que ejercita no busca puramente la gloria de Dios: 1.ª No turbarse cuando no se alcanza lo que se buscaba, porque, no siendo esto del agrado de Dios, tampoco es conforme a su voluntad. 2.ª Holgarse del bien obrado por otros como si uno mismo lo hubiera hecho. 3.ª No desear un cargo con preferencia a otro, aceptando gustoso el que indicare la obediencia a los superiores. 4.ª No buscar, después de ejercidos sus ministerios, el agradecimiento ni la aprobación de los demás; antes, por el contrario, viéndose criticado y censurado, no turbarse, cifrando su alegría en haber contentado únicamente a Dios. Y si por ventura se reciben alabanzas mundanas, no vanagloriarse, sino responder a la vanagloria que corre tras uno como respondió San Juan de Ávila: «También os reíd de la vanagloria, y decidle: Ni por ti lo hago, ni dejaré de hacer, Señor; a ti ofrezco cuanto hiciere, dijere y pensare. Y cuando venga la vanagloria, decidle: Tarde venís, que ya está dado a Dios».

Cuéntase en el Tesoro espiritual que cierto solitario, antes de ejecutar cualquier obra, se detenía un tantillo y dirigía los ojos al cielo. Preguntado por qué lo hacía, respondió: «Es que procuro asegurar la puntería»; queriendo con esto decir que así como el ballestero antes de lanzar la saeta fija la puntería para asegurar el blanco, así también él, antes de ejecutar cualquier acción, ponía la mira en Dios, para que fuese del divino agrado. Así debíamos hacer nosotros también, y hasta, una vez empezada la obra, no estaría de más que renovásemos de cuando en cuando la intención de agradar a Dios.

Cierto que fue criado para amaros; pero, lejos de ello, ¡cuántas veces se ha rebelado contra vos! Mas no olvidéis, Jesús mío, que, si hubo un tiempo en que se rebeló contra vos, ahora está postrado a vuestras plantas, arrepentido y atravesado de dolor por los disgustos que os ha causado. Sí, amado Redentor mío, me arrepiento de haberos despreciado y me resuelvo a amaros y serviros cueste lo que costare.

Amargamente lloro viendo cuán ingrato he sido con vos. ¡Pobre de mí! Mi perdición era segura, mas confío que con vuestra gracia me habéis restituido la vida.

David decía: “Y dije: «Ahora empiezo»” (Ps. 76, 11). Glosando San Carlos Borromeo estas palabras, exponía: «Ahora comienzo a servir a Dios». Y así tenemos que hacer, como si en lo pasado no hubiéramos hecho bien alguno, porque todo cuanto por Dios hacemos es nada, dado que todos estamos obligados a hacerlo por Él. Resolvámonos, pues, a diario a comenzar a ser todo de Dios; no nos detengamos a mirar lo que hacen los demás ni cómo lo hacen, puesto que contados son los que de veras se dan a la santidad.

Decía San Francisco de Sales que «el soportar los oprobios es la piedra de toque de la humildad y de la verdadera virtud». ¿Qué decir de una persona que pasa por espiritual, hace oración, comulga frecuentemente, ayuna y se mortifica, y, a vuelta de todo eso, no puede soportar una afrenta ni una palabrilla punzante? Que es una caña hueca, vacía de humildad y de virtud. Y ¿qué sabrá hacer el alma amante de Jesucristo si no sabe afrontar una afrenta por el amor de quien tantas afrontó por ella? En la Imitación de Cristo escribió Kempis: «Pues tanto horror tienes a las humillaciones, señal es de que no estás muerto al mundo, ni eres humilde, ni tienes a Dios ante los ojos. Quien no tiene siempre ante la vista a Dios, a la menor palabra de censura se turba». No tienes valor para sufrir por Dios bofetadas y heridas; soporta al menos cualquier palabrilla.

Muchas personas hay que hacen profesión de vida espiritual, pero son idólatras de la propia estima; exteriormente aparentan mucha virtud pero interiormente ambicionan ser loadas de todos por cuanto hacen, y si nadie las alaba, se alaban a sí mismas, queriendo aparecer mejores que las demás, y si por ventura les hieren la propia honra, pierden la paz, abandonan la comunión y las demás devociones y no descansan hasta haber recobrado el buen nombre que creyeron perdido.

Razón le sobraba a San Francisco de Asís para decir: «Soy tan sólo lo que soy ante Dios». ¿Qué importa ser tenido en mucha estima por los grandes del mundo, si ante Dios somos viles y despreciables? Y, por el contrario, ¿qué importa que el mundo nos desprecie, si somos queridos y gratos a los ojos de Dios? San Agustín escribió: «Ni los pregones del adulador remedian el mal estado de nuestra conciencia, ni los oprobios del calumniador son poderosos para herir la buena conciencia». Así como el que nos alaba no nos libra del castigo que nuestros pecados merecen, de la misma manera, el que nos vitupera no nos quita el mérito de nuestras buenas obras.

Si meditando en la Pasión no había advertido este aspecto de los sufrimientos de Cristo, cosa que es pasada por alto e inadvertida con frecuencia, éste será el lugar de no irse de los ejercicios sin comprender todo lo que incluyen las oblaciones hechas: desde el Rey (EE 98) y Dos Banderas (EE 147, 157, 167-168) en adelante, hasta la Contemplación para alcanzar Amor. Es algo que un discípulo de Cristo que quiere serlo a fondo, no puede ignorar, para responder con el don de sí mismo a un Dios que se le da a Sí mismo en esta forma.

Cristo quiso padecer y ser despreciado, y tú ¿te atreves a quejarte de alguna cosa? Cristo tuvo adversarios y murmuradores, y tú ¿quieres tener a todos por amigos y bienhechores? ¿Con qué se coronará tu paciencia, si ninguna adversidad se te ofrece? Si no quieres sufrir ninguna adversidad, ¿cómo serás amigo de Cristo? Sufre con Cristo y por Cristo, si quieres reinar con Cristo.

Para amar a Dios de todo corazón se necesitan dos cosas: la primera, vaciarlo de todo lo terreno, y la segunda, llenarlo de su santo amor. De donde resulta que aquél no entrega a Dios su corazón si lo tiene preso a las criaturas.

engaño está en que quieren hacerse santos, pero a su modo; quieren amar a Jesucristo, pero siguiendo su natural inclinación, sin renunciar a sus diversiones, a la vanidad en el vestir, a los alimentos regalados; aman a Dios, pero, si no logran tal empleo, viven en perpetua turbación; si se les hiere en su reputación, se encienden, y si no sanan de la enfermedad, pierden la paciencia. Aman a Dios, pero no dejan el afecto de las riquezas, a los honores mundanos y a la futilidad de ser tenidos por nobles, por sabios o por mejores que los demás. Estos tales frecuentan la oración y la comunión; mas, por cuanto llevan el corazón repleto de cosas terrenas, poco es el fruto que reportan. A éstos no les habla el Señor, porque da por perdidas sus palabras, como dijo precisamente a Santa Teresa: «Yo hablaría a muchas almas, pero el mundo hace tanto ruido en sus orejas, que no pueden oír mi voz».

La acedia del Hermano Mayor aparece como un no a la fiesta que ilustran las parábolas de los invitados al banquete del Reino 86. En el fondo de esta distonía de sentimientos entre el que se alegra y festeja y el que rehúsa entrar en esa alegría, hay una fractura de la comunión.

Una de las causas de la acedia es el miedo al Padre. “Vi claro - dice Nouwen - que ni mi formación teológica ni mi formación espiritual habían sido capaces de liberarme de la idea de un Dios Padre que seguía amenazándome y amedrentándome. Todo lo que había aprendido acerca del amor del Padre no me había permitido abandonar la idea de una autoridad que tenía poder sobre mí y que utilizaría ese poder según su voluntad. De alguna manera, el amor de Dios hacia mí estaba limitado por mi miedo hacia el poder de Dios, y lo más prudente era mantenerse a distancia, a pesar de que mi deseo de acercarme era inmenso. Sé que este sentimiento es compartido por muchas personas”.

acedia - que es envidia o sea tristeza por el Bien que es Dios, y que implica la soberbia de afirmar el querer propio contra la Voluntad divina - es el mejor de los nombres para el pecado del Ángel malo, del cual deriva luego el de nuestros protoparientes. Así lo define el libro de la Sabiduría: "Por acedia del diablo entró la muerte en el mundo y la experimentan (tanto la acedia como la muerte) los que le pertenecen" (Sabiduría 2,24; ver también 6,23 y 7,13).

San Juan Crisóstomo decía: “Como se pasa del amor al odio, así puede pasarse del odio al amor”94. Eso sucede cuando se experimenta la voluntad divina como opuesta y dañosa para la propia. Por diversos caminos se vuelve siempre a la lucha entre los apetitos de la carne y los del espíritu, de que nos ocupamos en el libro anterior. Pero el misterio de la acedia no puede explicarse en términos puramente morales. Es un misterio de orden espiritual. 4.2 La Acedia del Demonio según Aurelio Prudencio El poeta cristiano Aurelio Prudencio95 se hace eco en sus obras de la doctrina común en la Iglesia de los primeros siglos acerca de la envidia del demonio y de su rol en las persecuciones.

“Pues bien - concluye Padrón - esta situación histórica de la secularización, introduce existencialmente un desgarramiento y una angustia inevitables y directamente proporcionales al desconocimiento de Dios”110. Nótese que Padrón dice proporcionales al desconocimiento y no proporcionales a la ignorancia. Se trata de una negación intencionada de Dios. Y no de la negación de la idea de Dios 111, sino de la negación de su revelación histórica con todos sus signos y concreciones eclesiales y neumáticas.

La primera guerra proviene del apetito de goces sensuales; removamos las ocasiones, mortifiquemos la vista, encomendémonos a Dios, y cesará la batalla. La segunda guerra proviene de la sobrada codicia de bienes terrenos; procuremos amar la pobreza, y cesará la batalla. La tercera guerra proviene de la ambición de honores; amemos la humildad y la vida escondida, y cesará la batalla. Escribe San Bernardo que, cuando se ve a una persona turbada, se puede colegir que la causa de su turbación es el no poder dar gusto, a la sazón, a la propia voluntad.

Nuestra civilización rechaza la revelación de un Dios que ama al hombre. Consecuentemente se ha liberado del peso de tener que corresponderle amándolo a él y al prójimo. Pero al rechazar ser amado para no tener la obligación de responder con amor, va cayendo del no ser amado en el no ser digno de amor, o sea en el no ser amable, ni para sí ni para nadie. El que rechaza ser amable a los ojos de Dios terminará tarde o temprano siendo odioso a sus propios ojos. ¿Hay mayor calabozo de tristeza que no poder salir de esta prisión del yo que se odia?

When one has the power of a monopoly, like a bishop, it creates a serious obligation for that person. Some bishops have written that this comment is too strong, that it is not true. However, there have also been bishops who have agreed with me; these bishops were not offended. Therefore, I have never regretted having written this statement; undoubtedly it has been very stimulating, especially for those bishops who did not take exorcism seriously.

In practice, the abandonment of exorcism was a denial of the Devil’s action. And the Devil was happy about this! What most pleases the Devil is that his existence is disbelieved; about this, he is truly happy! Indeed, he does everything possible to keep himself hidden to make it appear as self-evident that evil powers do not exist. This has been, and is now, his greatest triumph.

God permits it because He looks ahead to eternal life. We are too tied to earthly life, to the things below, to what is immediate. Like children, we would like everything now, but God looks at the foundation of Jesus’ preaching: “My kingdom is not of this world” (see John 18:36). Therefore, we must detach ourselves from the good things of the world — not because they do not have value; rather, so that they do not become obstacles to our looking toward Heaven.

For example, if there is no forgiveness, there can never be any friendship or lasting bond. Forgiveness is also indispensable for marriages and for relationships between parents and children. If there is no forgiveness, nothing can last long. It is one of the foundations of charity! So one proceeds trusting in the Lord, knowing that one is a good-for-nothing.

For assurance, I exorcised him a few more times, because the liberations are often temporary: the demon goes away temporarily, hoping that the person will gradually distance himself from the Church and give himself over to a life of sin so that he can then snatch him again. In this case, the second possession will be worse than the previous time.

An exorcist friend who was older than I and who died some time ago once asked the Devil: “Tell me, what are the qualities of the Most Holy Mother Mary that make you so angry and cause you so much pain?” He answered: “She is the purest of everyone, and I am the filthiest; she is the humblest, and I am the most rebellious; she is the most obedient, and I never obey!” Once during an exorcism, I asked: “One of your colleagues gave this response regarding Our Lady to one of my colleagues. Now, tell me: what is the fourth quality of Our Lady that makes you angry?” He responded: “She always wins because she has never been touched by the slightest shadow of sin.”

While exorcism is a public prayer, liberation is private, prayed with the simple authority of one’s own faith in the Word of Jesus Christ. I have always said, speaking of the nations where there are no exorcists, to pray the prayers of liberation — above all, if one is a priest; but the laity can also say them, and there are many places where prayer groups, especially those of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, say them. If they are done with true faith, they obtain results.

Parents, as the priest of their own family, always have the duty to bless their family members, even by the laying on of hands. Even more so, parents have the right and the duty to make the sign of the cross on their children, blessing them. A parent’s blessing is very efficacious. When I was small, I did not go to bed without my mother’s blessing. Also, reciprocal blessings of spouses are highly advisable, because there is an extremely strong sacred bond between them, created through the sacrament of Marriage.

If I were pope for a day, I would give the faculty of exorcising to all priests, because the Gospel clearly says, “Go, heal, preach, cast out demons, and heal the sick.” Therefore, it is ridiculous that a priest can preach, hear confessions, and consecrate the host during Mass — all things that are much greater than doing exorcisms — yet they are forbidden to do exorcisms. Therefore, I say, let everyone — men and women — say the prayers of liberation, and let all priests do exorcisms. In each case, if they are done with faith, the prayers of liberation and exorcisms have the same efficacy.

San Juan de la Cruz, obligado a mudar de aires, debido a la enfermedad que lo llevó a la tumba, en vez de escoger monasterio cómodo y gobernado por un superior que lo estimaba mucho, eligió uno pobre que tenía por superior un adversario suyo, que por mucho tiempo, casi hasta el fin de la vida, lo maltrató y vilipendió de diversas maneras, llegando a prohibir a los religiosos fuesen a visitarlo.

Santa Teresa escribió esta memorable máxima: «En esta casa y aun toda persona que quisiere ser perfecta, huya mil leguas de «razón tuve», «hiciéronme sinrazón», «no tuvo razón quien esto hizo conmigo»; de malas razones nos libre Dios. ¿Parece que había razón para que nuestro buen Jesús sufriese tantas injurias, y se las hiciesen, y tantas sinrazones? La que no quisiere llevar cruz, sino la que le dieren muy puesta en razón, no sé yo para qué está en el monasterio; tórnese al mundo, adonde aun no le guardarán esas razones».

Célebre fue la respuesta del Crucifijo al mártir San Pedro, que se lamentaba de que con tamaña sinrazón se le encarcelaba, sin haber hecho mal alguno: «Y yo, ¿que mal hice –le preguntó el Señor–, para verme crucificado y muriendo por los hombres?».

Primero, es claro que estas potencias son fenómenos de los cuales se ha tenido conocimiento y experiencia fuera del cristianismo, o -para ser más exactos teológicamente-, fuera de la revelación contenida en el Antiguo y en el Nuevo Testamento. Desde la tradición de esta experiencia humana general fueron de algún modo aportados a la revelación.

el Nuevo Testamento se interesa del ámbito de las potencias o de los demonios sólo en cuanto es necesario defenderse de ellos y proteger el mundo de sus ataques. Por tanto, si así se puede decir, percibe la naturaleza de las apariciones demoníacas sólo en la medida en que se manifiesta como experiencia de ataque y defensa.

De aquí se puede concluir lo siguiente: En primer lugar, las potencias, que son presentadas como una suerte de esencias o seres personales, en el sentido indicado, son también «poder», «dominio», «fuerza», etc. Ellas son esto. No sólo tienen poder, dominio, fuerza, sino que son poder, dominio, fuerza. Ellas no son algo o alguien que además tenga poder, dominio, fuerza, etc., sino que existen como poder, dominio, fuerza. etc. Ellas se llaman así porque son lo que manifiestan sus nombres. Así, como tales, se manifiestan a sí mismas y a su esencia.

esta mujer enferma Jesús la llama «una hija de Abraham, a la que ató Satanás hace ya dieciocho años» (13,16). En otro texto se lee: «Entonces le fue presentado un endemoniado, que estaba ciego y mudo» (Mt 12,22). Con estas frases y otros giros parecidos no se intentan “explicar” las enfermedades como la ceguera o la sordera, al modo como podía hacerlo una medicina primitiva, como se dice frecuentemente. Por el contrario, se indica el significado del fenómeno que está en la base de la enfermedad como un acontecimiento histórico: que la enfermedad, sea del tipo que sea y tenga las causas humanas físicas y psíquicas que sean, representa la violencia de una potencia superior del mal que obra intencionalmente aún cuando al hombre pueda parecerle fortuito, y es obra de un calculador poder supremo del mal, aún cuando el hombre no pueda preverlo. Este poder supremo del mal manifiesta su esencia no sólo en la destrucción del cuerpo sino también en la ruina y en la locura del espíritu. En la así llamada enfermedad del espíritu (o en los hechos que fenomenológicamente se le parecen, por ejemplo, la epilepsia)26, todavía hoy nosotros mismos advertimos, espontáneamente porque nos falta en parte el conocimiento histórico de la enfermedad, el momento de la «posesión», que en un sentido amplio y profundo se verifica en todas las enfermedades.

Bajo esta misma luz el vidente del Apocalipsis, Juan, percibe la situación de persecución de los cristianos de Esmirna: «el diablo va a meter a algunos de vosotros en la cárcel» (Ap 2,10). Pero sobre todo debemos pensar en la siniestra descripción de Ap 13, donde la vida política y del estado, como también sus instituciones y personas, están impregnadas del espíritu satánico, que abusa de ellas para sus fines.

La fe es el fundamento de la caridad, sobre la que se funda; pero la caridad es la que perfecciona la fe; aquel cree con más firme y viva fe que con más intenso amor ama a Dios. La caridad hace que el hombre crea, no sólo con el entendimiento, sino también con la voluntad; hay muchos que creen con sólo el entendimiento y no con la voluntad, como los pecadores, que tienen por muy ciertas las verdades de la fe y a vuelta de ello se niegan a vivir conforme a los divinos mandamientos; estos tales están muy débiles en la fe; si la tuvieran viva, creyendo que la divina gracia es el mayor de todos los bienes y que el pecado es el mayor de todos los males, en cuanto que priva de la divina gracia, ciertamente mudarían de vida.

Quien ama a Jesucristo, ¡cuán bien comprende el dicho del Sabio: “Vanidad de vanidades, todo es vanidad!” (Eccl. 1, 2); que todas las grandezas terrenas son humo, engaño y podredumbre; que el único bien y la felicidad del alma consiste en amar a su Creador y cumplir su voluntad; que tanto somos cuanto somos ante Dios; que de poco vale ganar todo el mundo si se pierde el alma; que todos los bienes terrenos no pueden satisfacer plenamente el corazón humano, sino sólo Dios; en una palabra, que hay que dejarlo todo para ganarlo todo.

Enseña el Angélico que el grado más elevado de caridad a que puede llegar el alma en esta vida es desear ardientemente ir al cielo para unirse con Dios y gozar de Él eternamente. Pero este disfrutar de Dios en el cielo, como hemos ya apuntado, no consiste tanto en recibir el alma el gozo que Dios le da, cuanto en gozar del gozo de Dios, a quien el alma ama más que a sí misma.

Desde esa atmosfera, que él gobierna, y mediante ella, pues es su esfera de poder, ejercita, como estamos diciendo, su «influjo» sobre los hombres. Mediante la atmósfera espiritual, que es su dimensión, la dimensión de su poder, penetra en los hombres, se apodera de ellos y consolida su poder. Cuando los hombres se abren a esta atmósfera se convierten en sus portadores y contribuyen a su vez a su extensión.

Máximamente empieza a ejercer su poder en el espíritu general del mundo, en el espíritu de una época y en público, como también en el espíritu de un pueblo, de un país, etc. Este espíritu, en el que domina «el eón de este mundo»40, no es un espíritu suelto y suspendido en el aire, sino que es respirado por los hombres y por medio de ellos es asumido en sus instituciones, en unas u otras circunstancias. Él se condensa también en determinadas situaciones. Así llega a convertirse en un espíritu históricamente intensivo y poderoso, del cual ningún individuo puede escapar. El hombre se rige según este espíritu, y se le presenta como obvio por sí mismo. Actuar, pensar o decir algo contra él, es un sinsentido, cuando no es, incluso, injusto y delictivo. En él se lleva adelante la vida y todas las demás cosas. Y «en él» se piensa: tal como este espíritu nos lo presenta, con todos los conceptos y valoraciones propias de su presentación. El príncipe de este mundo, mediante la atmósfera dominada por él, hace que el mundo y la misma existencia, las cosas, las relaciones y situaciones de este mundo, aparezcan como suyas y según él las entiende.

Este revestirse de las armas de Dios, no es otra cosa que el apoyarse y abandonarse en la verdad, la justicia, la paz, la esperanza, la Palabra de Dios, y entre ellas, como un fundamento permanente, en la fe, que es el escudo con el cual se puede no sólo preservar de las flechas inflamadas del maligno, sino también disminuir y extinguir su ardor.

El combate contra los poderes se realiza siempre con el ejercicio de la fe. Fundamentalmente se lo puede realizar sólo conduciendo una batalla contra mí mismo. Porque estos enemigos, las potencias, tienen siempre un aliado que está dentro de mí: el pecado que llevamos desde Adán, el cual se muestra siempre, incluso en los bautizados, en la constante inclinación egoísta hacia mí mismo y en la constante e ingrata aversión que se erige contra Dios y contra los otros hombres, a quienes Dios me ha asignado, asignándolos también a mí. El aliado de los poderes que está en mí es el apego autosuficiente hacia mí mismo y la aversión contra Dios y contra mis prójimos, a quienes continuamente someto pecando de injusticia y de auto-justificación. Las declaraciones de Ef 2,1ss. muestran claramente que el hombre realiza la vida conforme a aquel espíritu tiránico que domina el «aire», y desde el aire todo, cuando cede a la búsqueda de sí mismo, a su terminar egoístamente en sí mismo, a su “concupiscencia”.

Estas potencias «consisten esencialmente» en esto: en que se apoderan del mundo en su totalidad y en sus particulares, de los hombres, de los elementos, de las instituciones políticas y sociales, de las relaciones y situaciones históricas, de las corrientes espirituales y religiosas, y por cierto y de manera principal y predominante y actualmente, de la «atmósfera», que es el lugar más próximo desde el que ejercen su dominio.

Los miembros de la Iglesia, que ya en el bautismo han sido arrancados de los poderes por Jesucristo, están obligados a oponer siempre más y más resistencia contra las potencias. Ellos deben vencerlos en la fe y con la obediencia, con las obras de justicia, con la verdad, con la oración continua, sobrios y vigilantes, y con el don del discernimiento de los espíritus. Deben crear en la Iglesia, mediante el sacrificio, un ámbito no dominado por las potencias, como signo del nuevo cielo y de la nueva tierra que están viniendo.

También es importante en tiempo de tentaciones hacer a menudo la señal de la cruz en el pecho y en la frente y, además, descubrir la tentación al director espiritual. «Tentación descubierta –decía San Felipe Neri–, tentación medio vendida».

veces tendrá el Señor guardada la victoria no para la primera súplica, sino para la segunda, la tercera o la cuarta. Persuadámonos, finalmente, de que de la oración depende todo nuestro bien; de la oración depende nuestra mudanza de vida; de la oración depende la victoria de las tentaciones; de la oración depende el alcanzar el amor divino, la perfección, la perseverancia y la salvación eterna.

Pero, como el alma se une a Dios más bien por los atractivos de los consuelos que siente que por la voluntad determinada de complacer a Dios, cree falsamente que su amor crece al paso que aumenta ese consuelo en las devociones. De aquí proviene que, cuando le turban en algún ejercicio de piedad en que se deleita, y tiene que emplearse en obras ajenas, sea de obediencia, de caridad u otras obligaciones de su estado, se inquieta y se turba: es éste un defecto muy universal de la miseria humana, ir buscando en todas las acciones la propia satisfacción; y cuando el alma no halla en sus ejercicios de devoción las antiguas satisfacciones, los abandona, o al menos, los disminuye y, quitando de aquí un tantillo y mañana otro de allí, acaba por dejarlo todo.

Por eso ofrezcámonos a padecer toda suerte de trabajos interiores y exteriores que nos sobrevengan: enfermedades, persecuciones, desolaciones de espíritu, diciendo: «Heme aquí, Señor mío; haced de mí y de mis cosas cuanto os agrade; dadme la gracia de amaros y de cumplir perfectamente vuestra voluntad, y nada más os pido».

Hagamos una distinción. Una cosa es hacer un acto bueno, como vencer una tentación, confiar en Dios, amarle y querer lo que Él quiere, y otra cosa es conocer que en verdad hacemos un acto bueno. Esto segundo, de tener conocimiento que hacemos algo de provecho, nos sirve de consuelo; pero el provecho está en lo primero, cuando en hecho de verdad se ejecuta un acto bueno. Se contenta Dios con lo primero, y de lo segundo priva al alma, quiero decir, del conocimiento de haber hecho aquel acto bueno, para así despojarla de toda satisfacción propia, que ningún valor añade a la acción hecha, puesto que más busca Dios nuestro provecho que nuestra satisfacción.

Satan is not interested in possessing people. What he wants is to remove them from God and make them fall into sin, because he wants to bring people to Hell, while God, on the other hand, wants to bring them to Heaven.

Y este amor, junto con los años y experiencia que tengo de algunos monasterios, podrá ser aproveche para atinar en cosas menudas más que los letrados, que por tener otras ocupaciones más importantes y ser varones fuertes no hacen tanto caso de cosas que en sí no parecen nada, y a cosa tan flaca como somos las mujeres todo nos puede dañar; porque las sutilezas del demonio son muchas para las muy encerradas, que ven son menester armas nuevas para dañar.

Tengo para mí que honras y dineros casi siempre andan juntos, y que quien quiere honra no aborrece dineros, y que quien los aborrece que se le da poco de honra. Entiéndase bien esto, que me parece que esto de honra siempre trae consigo algún interés de rentas o dineros; porque por maravilla hay honrado (3) en el mundo si es pobre; antes, aunque lo sea en sí, le tienen en poco. La verdadera pobreza trae una honraza consigo que no hay quien la sufra; la pobreza que es tomada por solo Dios, digo, no ha menester contentar a nadie, sino a él. Y es cosa muy cierta, en no habiendo menester a nadie, tener muchos amigos. Yo lo tengo bien visto por experiencia.

JESUCRISTO: 1. Hijo, aún te conviene aprender muchas cosas que no has aprendido bien. EL ALMA: 2. ¿Qué cosas son éstas, Señor? JESUCRISTO: 3. Que pongas tu deseo totalmente en sola mi voluntad, y no seas amador de ti mismo, sino afectuoso celador de lo que a Mí me agrada. Los deseos te encienden muchas veces, y te impelen con vehemencia; pero considera si te mueves por mi honra o por tu provecho. Si Yo soy la causa, bien te contentarás de cualquier modo que Yo lo ordenare; pero si algo tienes escondido de amor propio, con que siempre te buscas, mira que eso es lo que mucho te impide y agrava.

Guárdate, pues; no confíes demasiado en el deseo que tuviste sin consultarlo conmigo; porque puede ser que después te arrepientas, y te descontente lo que primero te agradaba, y que por parecerte mejor lo deseaste. Porque no se puede seguir luego cualquier deseo que aparece bueno, ni tampoco huir a la primera vista toda afición que parece contraria. Conviene algunas veces reprimir el ímpetu, aun en los buenos ejercicios y deseos, porque no caigas por importunidad en distracción del alma, y porque no causes escándalo a otros con tu indiscreción, o por la contradicción de otros te turbes luego y deslices.

We must be careful because we live and work in a world where the devil wants to destroy the power of the Church, toppling the priesthood of Christ. We must also learn to work with our medical colleagues in the realm of mental health: they can offer a substantial service to the Church. We must learn to have faith in their claims, just as they must have faith in ours. After all, our goal is the same: the salvation of the individual as a person.

One time there was a possessed man, and while I was exorcising him I spoke to the demon: “Why don’t you just go away?” I asked him. He said, “No, because Satan will punish me!” Yes, among the demons there is a hierarchy, just like among the angels. It’s a hierarchy based on hate. They loathe each other, they’re terrified of each other because the strongest one can hurt the weaker ones.

This brings me to say that the devil hates holy priests who are already dead, but he nurses an even more profound resentment for the living Church: the priests, the bishops, the Pope. In fact, these consecrated people are frequently attacked, and unfortunately, in the face of such a far-reaching assault, we have a clergy and an episcopate that is absolutely unfit not only to respond to requests for help, but even to listen to them. As soon as they hear talk of these problems, “It’s all stories!” they say.

I asked a demon—I asked this various times to various demons—“If you could go back, what would you do?” They all respond: “I’d do exactly what I’m doing now!” And they tell me: “Don’t you understand that I had the courage to oppose God? Don’t you understand that I am therefore stronger than him?” They believe their rebellion against God proves that they are stronger than their creator.

en mujeres creo debe ser esto aun más que en hombres; y hace daños para la comunidad muy notorios; porque de aquí viene el no se amar tanto todas, el sentir el agravio que se hace a la amiga, el desear tener para regalarla, el buscar tiempo para hablarla, y muchas veces más para decirle lo que la quiere y otras cosas impertinentes que lo que ama a Dios. Porque estas amistades grandes pocas veces van ordenadas a ayudarse a amar más a Dios, antes creo las hace comenzar el demonio para comenzar bandos en las religiones; que cuando es para servir a Su Majestad, luego se parece, que no va la voluntad con pasión, sino procurando ayuda para vencer otras pasiones.

Hijo, en cualquier cosa di así: Señor, si te agradare, hágase esto así. Señor, si es honra tuya, hágase esto en tu nombre. Señor, si vieres que me conviene, y hallares serme provechoso, concédemelo para que use de ello a honra tuya. Mas si conocieres que me sería dañoso, y nada provechoso a la salvación de mi alma, desvía de mí tal deseo. Porque no todo deseo procede del Espíritu Santo, aunque parezca justo y bueno al hombre. Dificultoso es juzgar si te incita buen espíritu o malo a desear esto o aquello, o si te mueve tu propio espíritu.

No es verdadero paciente el que no quiere padecer sino lo que le acomoda, y de quien le parece. El verdadero paciente no mira quién le ofende, si es superior, igual o inferior; si es hombre bueno y santo, o perverso e indigno. Sino que cualquier adversidad que le venga de cualquiera criatura indiferentemente, y en cualquier tiempo, la recibe de buena gana, como de la mano de Dios, y la estima por mucha ganancia. Porque nada de cuanto se padece por Dios, por poco que sea, puede pasar sin mérito ante su divino acatamiento.

Por eso, Señor Dios, tengo también por grande beneficio no tener muchas cosas de las cuales me alaben y honren los hombres; de modo que cualquiera que considere la pobreza y vileza de su persona, no sólo no recibirá pesadumbre, ni tristeza, ni abatimiento, sino más bien consuelo y grande alegría.

¿Pues en qué consiste, Señor? JESUCRISTO: 5. En ofrecerte de todo tu corazón a la divina voluntad, no buscando tu interés en lo poco, ni en lo mucho, ni en lo temporal, ni en lo eterno. De manera que con rostro igual, des gracias a Dios en las cosas prósperas y adversas, pensándolo todo con un mismo peso. Si fueres tan fuerte y firme en la esperanza que, quitándote la consolación interior, aún esté dispuesto tu corazón para padecer mayores penas, y no te justificares, diciendo que no debieras padecer tales ni tantas cosas, sino que me tuvieres por justo y alabares por santo en todo lo que Yo ordenare, cree entonces que andas en el recto camino de la paz, y podrás tener esperanza cierta de ver nuevamente mi rostro con júbilo. Y si llegares al perfecto menosprecio de ti mismo, sábete que entonces gozaras de abundancia de paz, cuanto cabe en este destierro.

¿Por qué te fatigas con superfluos cuidados? Está a mi voluntad, y no sentirás daño alguno. Si buscas esto o aquello, y quisieres estar aquí o allí por tu provecho, y propia voluntad, nunca tendrás quietud, ni estarás libre de cuidados; porque en todas hay alguna falta, y en cada lugar habrá quien te ofenda.

No te tengas por desamparado del todo, aunque te envíe a tiempos alguna tribulación, o te prive del consuelo deseado; porque de este modo se llega al reino de los cielos. Y sin duda te conviene más a ti, y a los demás siervos míos, ser ejercitados en adversidades, que si todo os sucediese a vuestro gusto. Yo penetro los secretos; y sé que te conviene mucho para tu bien, que algunas veces te deje desconsolado; para que no te ensoberbezcas en los sucesos prósperos, ni quieras complacerte en ti mismo por lo que no eres. Lo que yo te di, te lo puedo quitar, y volvértelo cuando me agradare.

Si no hallas en ti culpa, llévalo con gusto por Dios. Muy poco es el que sufras alguna vez siquiera malas palabras, ya que aún no puedes tolerar grandes golpes. Y ¿por qué tan pequeñas cosas te llegan al corazón, sino porque aún eres carnal, y miras mucho más a los hombres de lo que conviene? Porque temes ser despreciado, por esto no quieres ser reprendido de tus faltas, y buscas la sombra de las excusas.

Religion, because it offers a rival authority to the state; the family, because it means a rival loyalty to the state; and property, because it means material independence of the state.”914

Prayer which springs from inner longing must, on the whole, be considered as the exception. Anyone proposing to build his religious life on this foundation would most probably give up prayer altogether. He would be like a person trying to base his life entirely on intuition and impressions, leaving aside order, discipline, and work. Such a life would be at the mercy of chance; it would become self-indulgent, arbitrary, fanciful; earnestness and steadfastness would vanish.

In matters of prayer we are only too apt to deceive ourselves because, generally speaking, man does not enjoy praying. He easily experiences boredom, embarrassment, unwillingness, or even hostility. Everything else appears to him more attractive and more important. He persuades himself that he has not got the time, that there are other more urgent things to do; but no sooner has he given up prayer than he applies himself to the most trivial tasks. We should stop lying to God. Better to say openly, “I do not wish to pray,” than to make such excuses. Better not to resort to specious justifications such as, for instance, tiredness, but to declare, “I do not feel like praying.” This may sound less decorous, but at least it is the truth which leaves the way open, whereas self-deception does not.

This, however, is difficult where faith lacks conviction, for prayer helps only if it is practiced not merely for the sake of its possible effects, but for the sake of the inner relationship to God. It is important that those who believe in this relationship, or who are aware of it, should constantly renew it.

We are like the sick man; we are sick in our relationship to God and to the world. We cannot therefore make our natural feelings the true standard for our religious attitude, but must follow enlightened opinion in order to put ourselves and our feelings right. The supposed truthfulness which consists in doing what inclination demands is frequently an evasion of truth. In the practice of prayer, therefore, we must also endeavor to seek what is right and to do it loyally and, if need be, against our inclinations.

This unrest which grips us when we are about to pray may also be defined as an urge to be somewhere else. We can yield to this urge by getting up and going, either into the next room or into the street or to the office; or we may look out of the window or take up a book or think of something else: of people or professional matters, or of anything that comes into our mind. Always this inner unrest drives us away from the place where we should be, namely, the here and the duty.

Man in this state is not really a person who speaks or who can be spoken to, but merely an uncoordinated bundle of thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Recollectedness means that he who prays gathers himself together, directs his attention to what he is doing, draws in all thought — a painstaking task — so as to dedicate himself to prayer as a unified whole. This is the state in which he may, when the call comes to him, answer in the words of Moses, “Here I am.”1

Anyone who says that prayer has nothing to offer him, that he feels no urge to pray, or that his prayer “does not ring true” and that therefore he had better leave it, misses the essential point of prayer. To be able to persevere through the hours of emptiness has a special value which cannot be replaced by the most inspired prayer at some other time. Only he who takes his faith seriously can continue to speak through the darkness without receiving any response — he knows that he is heard by Him to whom he speaks.

As soon as man comes into the proximity of God, he is confronted by this holiness, becomes aware of it, and responds to it in various ways.  He becomes aware that he himself is not holy, that he is profane and earthly — indeed, that he is sinful and guilty. He realizes that he is not fit to be in the presence of God and wishes either to go away from Him, or to say with Peter, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.”13

True forgiveness, the forgiveness which we are seeking and which alone is of benefit to us, is a great mystery. It implies not only that God decides to overlook what has happened and turns lovingly toward the sinner; this would not be sufficient. God's forgiveness is creative: it makes him who has become guilty free of all guilt. God gathers the guilty man into His holiness, makes him partake of it, and gives him a new beginning. It is to this mystery that man appeals when he acknowledges his sins, repents of them, and seeks forgiveness.

We must guard against that attitude of spiritual pride which makes us say, “What I do not feel I do not need.” We must allow for the possibility that our feelings may be unreliable and therefore we must honestly strive to correct them. Yearning for God is inborn in human nature. If it is lacking, it does not follow that we have no need of God, but rather that we may be sick and in need of healing.

The yearning for God is a form of prayer This yearning for God — a yearning for union, for participation — is also prayer. The story is told of St. Thomas Aquinas that when he had finished an important section of his great work on divine truth, Christ appeared to him and said, “Thou hast written well about me, Thomas. What shall I give thee?” St. Thomas, the legend goes, answered, “Thyself, Lord.” St. Teresa expressed this yearning even more forcefully when she wrote: “Only God is sufficient.”21  The deepest core, the highest aspirations, the whole essence and purpose of man's striving can be summed up in the proposition: man's soul longs for union with God. This is not merely the expression of a pious sentiment; it is the precise truth.  We want to possess that which we consider to be precious and real. But is there anything in the world which we are really able to possess? Something catches our fancy, we buy it, we take it and carry it home, but do we really possess it? It is true we can make use of it; we can prevent anyone else having it, but is it ever truly ours? Not only may we lose it, not only can it be ruined, not only shall we have to give it up one day — we never really have it; we only hold it externally. We are never able to form that innermost union between ourselves and things which alone can be called having; there always remains a gulf.  The same applies to human relations. We want to establish a close relationship — a true union — with another person. We want to be certain of the other person, but can we ever achieve this? We may gain a person's confidence or love; we may be linked to that person by the strongest bonds of loyalty and devotion, but ultimately that person still remains distant and inaccessible. God alone, the all-true, the all-being, the Holy, the Remote, is able to give Himself fully to man. Neither things nor persons, nor even we ourselves can fully become our own: only God can create that nearness that fulfills our yearning.

How, then, can God become our own? That He, who is Lord of Himself and of all creation, wishes to give Himself to us, and that it is compatible with His divinity to do so, only He Himself can reveal to us. Moreover, He must give us faith so that we may believe it and consummate the union. This is the mystery of divine love, that in it all love has its origin and finds its complete fulfillment. We must therefore beseech God for the grace of His love and for grace to respond to it.

Man submits because he knows that this is right and just in itself. If adoration merely expressed “I submit to Thee because Thou art stronger than I,” this would be a feeble and ultimately unworthy sentiment.

Having invested man with the dignity of free will and responsibility, God treats him in a manner befitting this status; in other words, He honors man. This does not imply that man possesses anything in his own right which would compel God's respect, for whatever man possesses, including his status as a person, God has given to him. But having given it to him, God treats him accordingly. For the sake of His own honor, God maintains the dignity of man.

Then, again, it may happen that we are unable to conceive of God as a living reality. He appears to us as a pious thought, a holy mood — something beautiful but far away and ephemeral which has no place in the actuality of life.

there is also prayer which is a confession of ignorance, an admission of failure before the mystery. There is the prayer of plenitude, when God's presence is fully experienced; but there is also the prayer of privation when it appears that God has forsaken us, leaving a great void which nothing can fill.  There are times when everything seems intelligible and familiar, and there are times when nothing seems to make sense or to be worthwhile, when there is no hope and no one to turn to — times when we must persevere in silence. All these different times demand their own forms of prayer.

We do not pray merely to communicate our needs to God — He knows our hearts better than we do. Prayer is an intimate form of speaking which should bear the mark of our personality. In prayer we live before God, offer up to Him what is ours to offer, and receive from Him what it pleases Him to give to us. Therefore the language of our prayer should be truly our own.

The texts established by pious people are imbued with their experiences and with their struggles; in using these texts we make them part of our own schooling. They not only teach us how to express our own thoughts, but can awaken in us thoughts and feelings which may have been dormant. The prayers of saints are veritable journeys of discovery in the land of the spirit, paths that lead to God — intimations of a new life.

What we are striving to apprehend in contemplation are not the truths of the empirical world and of existential experience, but the truths of divine Revelation that have come to us in the word of God and the life of Christ.  There is something very special about revealed truth. It contains the most profound essence-being of the world and of man; but it expresses it as seen by God, embedded in the self-manifestation of God — God who is hidden and unknown, who declares Himself only through Christ.

It is not demanded of us that we should learn hitherto unknown facts and inner connections. It is demanded of us that we should accept aspects of truth which we can receive only from the mouth of God and that we should make the truth our own through faith. To make this truth our own we must grow into it, become one with it.  Our willfulness resists this. Understanding therefore demands that we should change not only our ways but our way of seeing and of judging, our sense of what is true and what is false, of what is real and what is appearance, and, generally, our sense of value. Our spirit must work its way into the holy words; our heart must get accustomed to them. Only by doing so shall we be able to grasp the divine message.

It is of paramount importance — we must repeat this — for contemplation to become prayer. The worshipper must reach out to the living God, must become aware of His holy presence, must seek out His holy countenance and enter into His heart. Contemplation should become a real dialogue in which man's I faces its true Thou, which is God. This is what fundamentally matters, so much so that there would be no further need for questioning, considering, and resolve, provided that this holy encounter were brought about at the very outset.

As to the significance and effect of such an experience, no general explanation is possible. It can mean, above all, a profound and inward reassurance of the reality of the living God and may become an infinitely precious aid to faith. Anyone who has undergone this experience may be able to say (with St. Paul), “I know to whom I have given my faith.”66 Once we have had this experience, we cannot easily forget that God exists and abides with us.  It also represents a challenge, calling man to a closer intimacy and partnership with God. It summons him to purify his life, to avoid with greater determination the entanglements of the world, and to turn himself wholeheartedly to God. At the same time it assures him of his ability to do so by giving him his own ground on which to stand and a source of power on which to draw.

Then we must learn to understand the world and history in the context of Providence, overcoming the concept of an impersonal, mechanistic world order which has been forced upon us by science and is reflected in the attitude of the masses. This conception is false. By it, the world is taken out of the hands of God, but it does not thereby acquire an independent scientific or cultural status, but passes into the hands of God's enemy. Thus the task is, by contemplation, to draw the world back into its true focus. The doctrine of Providence runs counter to the general trend of opinion. Here we must hold our ground. It is the battle of faith whose victory “overcomes the world”74 — the old unregenerate world — and ushers in the new, eternal one.

God demands something of me which belongs to “His kingdom and its righteousness.”75 He demands it of me and He demands it now. He will enable me to understand what this is. “How?” we might ask. We obtain this understanding not through mystical experience or illumination but through the truth inherent in the situation. The truth of this situation will be revealed as soon as we cease to regard it from the point of view of the world or our own self-will, but take it to God, ready to submit it to His judgment.

The uncertainty about what to do may spring from various sources. For instance, the situation may not as yet present a clear challenge and one cannot therefore know what is the right course: in this case one should not act but wait. Or vision and judgment may be lacking, in which case one should do one's best according to one's lights. The obscurity may be due to the fact that man is not in agreement with God; his own will pits itself against the manifest will of God, blinding vision and blurring judgment.  As soon as he has convinced himself that the will of God is right and salutary, and he has made himself free and ready to act upon it, the uncertainties vanish — although not necessarily all those which come merely from the unripeness of the situation or the incapacity of understanding or judgment, but those which arise from the resistance of the will.

The right way to offer ourselves to God All the same, the way in which this conception should be formulated and put into practice needs to be given some thought. Frequently the so-called ordering of our actions toward God takes very little account of what this really means but merely consists in giving to the action — provided of course it is morally good or at least unobjectionable — a label “To the Glory of God” (rather in the nature of a mathematical sign).  But does not this show a certain disregard for the true essence of the action? The glory of God is not served by doing something merely as a duty or at least to avoid sin, and then offering it up to God, but rather by doing right for its own sake and for what would seem to be God's own reasons, in the way in which circumstances demand and conscience approves, as men have a right to expect and in accordance with tact, friendship, love, loyalty, and honor. What is thus right in itself is brought by that same dedication before the Creator, the Lord of all things.

What ultimately determines the value of our action is the intention or motive behind it, whether the results are commensurate with this or not.  The intention, however, must not disregard the action itself. On the contrary, we must see to it, to the best of our ability, that the action is both appropriate and sensible. A good deed does not consist in meaning the right thing and doing it just anyhow, but rather it consists in our doing it as well as we can and in our obedience to the will of the Creator as it is expressed in the laws of the world.

The world which is seemingly so clearly defined, distinct, sure, and so utterly concrete, is in fact none of these things; in it God is effecting a constant process of transformation. Under cover of the old, in day-to-day events, encounters, and actions, grows the new world, which will be completed at the second coming of Christ. True eschatological feeling consists in bearing the idea of this process in mind and carrying it as a solace and inner strength, putting oneself in contact with the all-permeating mystery of divine government.

There is a world of difference between personal and merely subjective prayer. Prayer deserves to be called personal when it arises out of the dignity of man answering for himself, from the fountainhead of his inner life, and from the immediate encounter between him and his Creator and Redeemer. Prayer must be called subjective when the individual merely seeks himself, putting what seems true to him and his own uncertain religious sentiments in the place of revealed truth.

3 It is impossible to believe alone, just as it is impossible to be born by oneself or to engender oneself. . . Faith is not just an individual decision that the believer makes interiorly; it is not an isolated relation between the I of the faithful and the divine Thou, between the autonomous subject and God. Some people today would like to reduce faith to a subjective, private experience. Nevertheless, faith always comes about in the community of the Church, because that is where God reveals himself fully and allows himself to be encountered as he is in reality. In his dialogue with priests on Saint Peter’s Square at the conclusion of the Year for Priests (June 10, 2010), Pope Benedict XVI said: “There is no majority against the majority of the Saints. Saints are the true majority in the Church and we must orient ourselves by the Saints!” In what way does this priority given to sanctity have a particular resonance today?

The chief preoccupation of all the disciples of Jesus must be their sanctification. The first place in their lives must be given to prayer, to silent contemplation, and to the Eucharist, without which all the rest would be vain agitation. The saints love and live in the truth and are concerned about leading sinners to the truth of Christ. They could never remain silent about this truth or display the least indulgence toward sin or error. Love for sinners and for those who are in error requires that we fight relentlessly against their sins and errors.

God, who willed everything, did not create nature for its own sake. God did not create us for a merely natural perfection. God had an infinitely higher purpose than the perfection of nature alone: the supernatural order, the gift of pure love that we call grace, which makes us participate in his own divine nature, the communication of his own life that makes us his children, capable of knowing him and loving him in all his intimacy, as he knows and loves himself. We were created to get out of the world and to live fully with God’s own life. We were created to know and to love God in his full reality as God. Man by himself is absolutely incapable of this supernatural life, from which he is separated by an infinite abyss; it is a gratuitous gift of God. But we are made to live with God and to reach our perfection in God.

As for you, dear son of mine, persevere in praying to me. Hold fast to my Rosary and beware of every ploy of the Evil One to separate you from it. My Rosary is your safeguard and your weapon in the fight against the forces of evil. At the same time, for you it is a remedy and a comfort. Do you not see how the Rosary has stabilized you? Do you not experience its healing and all its benefits? Pray my Rosary and teach others to do the same.

This is the underlying problem of so many souls, especially of so many of My priests. They allow doubt to take hold. Doubt is the narrow end of the wedge that separates from Me. I do not refer to a doubt of My teachings or of those of My Church, but to another doubt, one that is more fundamental: the doubt of My personal love for the soul upon whom I have set My Heart. So many begin to think, “He cannot possibly love me in this way or take a real interest in me”—and so they begin to withdraw from My friendship, to flee My presence, and to greet Me only from a distance as one would a passing acquaintance.

There is dissension in your life when two interests compete for your time, your attention, and your energy. Allow My Mother to re-order your life, and you will discover the joy of living in a holy simplicity, in an order that anticipates the glorious order prepared for all My saints in heaven.

You are learning, at last, not to force events and not to manipulate people so as to have your own way. I want you to trust Me absolutely and in all things. Nothing escapes My attention. You are close to My Heart. My Mother watches over you. She is your advocate and your perpetual help. Go to her confidently with your doubts, your worries, and your fears. Trust in her maternal Heart is never misplaced, and she will never disappoint you.

So many emphasize that they must wait for Me, and yet I am already present, close to them, and disposed to reveal to them the secrets of My Heart. They forget that it is I who wait for them to come to Me. How often did I say to My disciples, “Come to Me.”2 They understood, at least most of them did, the intensity of My longing for the company of souls.3 I would have all souls come to Me and remain with Me.

Now you see a little better why consecration to My Mother is not only desirable and praiseworthy; it is necessary.1 It is the condition apart from which the realization of My promises in souls and in the Church—and especially in the priesthood of the Church—will continue to be thwarted and delayed. By consecration, I mean more than a simple act of devotion by which a person or group or nation is entrusted to My Mother’s love; I mean a clear recognition of her role in My work of salvation and, then, a deliberate and conscious surrender to that role in all its implications.

How does one come to that degree of trust? By entrusting to Me very little things, day by day, as they arise, and by leaving them to Me. This was also the wisdom of My priest Don Dolindo.3 “Jesus,” he used to say to Me, “you take care of this.” And then he went his way lighthearted and confident that I would honour the confidence he placed in Me.

Heart grieves over so many priests who have no desire to approach Me in the Sacrament of My love. Their hearts have grown cold, but My Heart burns with love for them still. How I suffer from their coldness, their indifference, their lack of desire for Me and for the friendship I offer them. I make Myself a beggar before them. I plead with them to accept My friendship and to give Me each day but an hour of their time. So much of their time is wasted pursuing things of no value, things of no consequence, and I, all the while, wait for them to come to Me.

It is a ploy of Satan to make souls believe that I am a harsh and demanding God, that I am never satisfied with the humble offerings of My children, and that I withdraw My presence from those who seek Me, spurning their attempts to find Me, and frustrating all their desires to know Me and to know My love for them. Lies, all lies to prevent souls from approaching Me. I am, of all friends, the most gentle and the most grateful.

To be a priest is to enter ontologically into this offering of self to the Father for the Church that Jesus exemplified throughout his life. It is to adopt the sacrifice of the Cross as the form of one’s whole life. The priesthood is an ontological participation in Christ’s self-deprivation in this way.

That is what we celebrate when we glory in the Cross of our Redeemer. . . . When we proclaim Christ crucified we are proclaiming not ourselves, but him. We are not offering our own wisdom to the world, nor are we claiming any merit of our own, but we are acting as channels for his wisdom, his love, his saving merits. We know that we are merely earthenware vessels, and yet, astonishingly, we have been chosen to be heralds of the saving truth that the world needs to hear. Let us never cease to marvel at the extraordinary grace that has been given to us, let us never cease to acknowledge our unworthiness, but at the same time let us always strive to become less unworthy of our noble calling, lest through our faults and failings we weaken the credibility of our witness. . . . As we proclaim the Cross of Christ, let us always strive to imitate the selfless love of the one who offered himself for us on the altar of the Cross, the one who is both priest and victim, the one in whose person we speak and act when we exercise the ministry that we have received.14

This was their first priestly action, their first mandate as priests of the New Covenant: not to preach, not to teach, not to heal, not even to baptize, but to watch and pray with Me. I wanted them to understand by this that unless a priest keeps watch and perseveres in prayer, all else will be in vain. He will dispense the substance of My mysteries, but without the sweetness of a heavenly unction, without the fire and light of a personal experience of My divine friendship. This is why I beg My priests to become adorers, to begin to watch and pray, close to Me in the Sacrament of My love.

It is no use. There is nothing left here for you. You are incapable of the vocation you thought you heard. Accept your failure to live it and admit that you were deceived.” This is not My voice.

Sabed, hijas, que no está la falta para ser o no ser oración mental en tener cerrada la boca. Si hablando, estoy enteramente entendiendo y viendo que hablo con Dios con más advertencia que en las palabras que digo, junto está oración mental y vocal.

¡Oh, válgame Dios!, pues acá, cuando uno se casa, primero sabe con quién, quién es y qué tiene. Nosotras, ya desposadas, antes de las bodas, que nos ha de llevar a su casa, pues acá no quitan estos pensamientos a las que están desposadas con los hombres (8), ¿por qué nos han de quitar que procuremos entender quién es este hombre y quién es su Padre y qué tierra es ésta adonde me ha de llevar y qué bienes son los que promete darme, qué condición tiene, cómo podré contentarle mejor, en qué le haré placer, y estudiar cómo haré mi condición que conforme con la suya? Pues si una mujer ha de ser bien casada, no le avisan otra cosa sino que procure esto, aunque sea hombre muy bajo su marido.

Y si conoce a uno por mudable y que no está firme en el bien y con gran determinación de perseverar, no le dejará a sol ni a sombra. Miedos le pondrá e inconvenientes que nunca acabe. Yo lo sé esto muy bien por experiencia, y así lo he sabido decir, y digo que no sabe nadie lo mucho que importa.

miradle resucitado; que sólo imaginar cómo salió del sepulcro os alegrará. Mas ¡con qué claridad y con qué hermosura! ¡Con qué majestad, qué victorioso, qué alegre! Como quien tan bien salió de la batalla adonde ha ganado un tan gran reino, que todo le quiere para vos, y a sí con él. Pues ¿es mucho que a quien tanto os da volváis una vez los ojos a mirarle?

But among all those who seek eternal Wisdom how many can honestly say with Solomon, “I have resolved to possess him”? The majority of men do not make such a resolution with real sincerity. Their decisions are mere wishful thinking or at best weak and wavering resolves. That is why they never find eternal Wisdom.

How many times while here on earth could he be heard pleading, “Come to me, come to me, all of you. Do not be afraid, it is I. Why are you afraid? I am just like you; I love you. Are you afraid because you are sinners? But they are the very ones I am looking for; I am the friend of sinners. If it is because you have strayed from the fold through your own fault, then I am the good shepherd. If it is because you are weighted down with sin, covered with grime and utterly dejected, then that is just why you should come to me for I will unburden you, purify you and console you.”

This worldly wisdom consists in an exact conformity to the maxims and fashions of the world; a continual inclination towards greatness and esteem; and a subtle and endless pursuit of pleasure and self-interest, not in an uncouth and blatant way by scandalous sin, but in an astute, discreet, and deceitful way. Otherwise the world would no longer label it wisdom but pure licentiousness.

In short, a man is worldly-wise who, following solely the lead of his senses and human reasoning, poses as a good Christian and a man of integrity, but makes little effort to please God or atone by penance for the sins he has committed against him.

“Do you not know that lovers endure suffering upon suffering for the sake of the one they love? For them wakeful nights are pleasant, fatigue is delightful, labor is restful, once they are assured that the one they love is pleased and grateful. If men go to such lengths to please a mere mortal, are you not ashamed to show weakness in your resolve to obtain Wisdom? No, eternal Wisdom, I will never falter in my love for you, even though I have to plunge through thicket and bush to reach you, even though I have to undergo a thousand torments in body and soul. I will always prize your friendship more than anything else on earth and you will always have the first place in my affections.”

Seeing himself in such a state, Henry Suso forgot his resolution to be brave no matter what might happen and gave way to deep depression, weeping and wondering why God had afflicted him in this way. As he pondered over his plight, he fell asleep. Early next morning he heard a voice reproaching him, “Look at this warrior of mine. He can scale mountains, climb over rocks, break into strongholds, cut to pieces his enemies when everything is going right for him. But when he meets with adversity his courage fades and he is helpless and useless. In time of consolation he is a fierce lion, but in time of tribulation he is a timid deer. Wisdom does not share his friendship with such faint-hearted cowards.” At this reprimand, Blessed Henry confessed he was wrong in giving way to excessive discouragement, and went on to ask divine Wisdom to allow him to weep and so unburden his heart weighed down by grief.

We read in the life of Blessed Henry Suso, a Dominican friar, that in his eagerness to possess Wisdom, he often offered himself to undergo any torment in return for his friendship. One day he said to himself, “Do you not know that lovers endure suffering upon suffering for the sake of the one they love? For them wakeful nights are pleasant, fatigue is delightful, labor is restful, once they are assured that the one they love is pleased and grateful. If men go to such lengths to please a mere mortal, are you not ashamed to show weakness in your resolve to obtain Wisdom? No, eternal Wisdom, I will never falter in my love for you, even though I have to plunge through thicket and bush to reach you, even though I have to undergo a thousand torments in body and soul. I will always prize your friendship more than anything else on earth and you will always have the first place in my affections.” 102. While traveling a few days later, he fell into the hands of robbers who beat him so unmercifully that they themselves could not help pitying him. Seeing himself in such a state, Henry Suso forgot his resolution to be brave no matter what might happen and gave way to deep depression, weeping and wondering why God had afflicted him in this way. As he pondered over his plight, he fell asleep. Early next morning he heard a voice reproaching him, “Look at this warrior of mine. He can scale mountains, climb over rocks, break into strongholds, cut to pieces his enemies when everything is going right for him.

Wisdom does not share his friendship with such faint-hearted cowards.” At this reprimand, Blessed Henry confessed he was wrong in giving way to excessive discouragement, and went on to ask divine Wisdom to allow him to weep and so unburden his heart weighed down by grief. “No,” replied the voice, “all the saints in heaven would lose their respect for you,. were you to cry like a baby or a woman. Wipe away your tears and show the world a cheerful face.” 103. The cross, then, is the portion and reward of those who desire or already possess eternal Wisdom. But our loving Savior numbers, weighs and measures everything and sends crosses to his friends in proportion to their strength, and tempers them with divine unction to such an extent that their hearts are filled with joy.

But his power is regulated by his love. He wishes to become incarnate in order to convince men of his friendship; he wishes to come down upon earth to help men to go up to heaven. So be it! It would be expected then that this Wisdom incarnate would appear glorious and triumphant, accompanied by millions and millions of angels, or at least by millions of chosen men and women. With these armies, majestic in his splendor and untouched by poverty, dishonor, humiliations and weaknesses, he will crush all his enemies and win the hearts of men by his attractiveness, his delights, his magnificence and his riches.

But O wonder! He perceives something which is a source of scandal and horror to Jews and an object of foolishness to pagans. (cf 1 Cor 1.23) He sees a piece of vile and contemptible wood which is used to humiliate and torture the most wicked and the most wretched of men, called a gibbet, a gallows, a cross. It is upon this cross that he casts his eyes; he takes his delight in it; he cherishes it more than all that is great and resplendent in heaven and on earth. He decides that that will be the instrument of his conquests, the adornment of his royal state. He will make it the wealth and joy of his empire, the friend and spouse of his heart. O the depths of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How amazing is his choice and how sublime and incomprehensible are his ways! But how inexpressible his love for that cross! (Rom 11.33)

The Cross even today is a source of scandal and an object of folly not only to Jews and pagans, Moslems and heretics, the worldly-wise and bad Catholics, but even to seemingly devout and very devout people. Yes, the Cross remains an object of scandal, folly, contempt and fear: not in theory, for never has so much been spoken or written about its beauty and its excellence than in these times; but in practice, because people lose courage, complain, excuse themselves, and run away as soon as a possibility of suffering arises.

Wise and honest people living in this world, you do not understand the mysterious language of the Cross. You are too fond of sensual pleasures and you seek your comforts too much. You have too much regard for the things of this world and you are too afraid to be held up to scorn or looked down upon. In short, you are too opposed to the Cross of Jesus. True, you speak well of the Cross in general, but not of the one that comes your way. You shun this as much as you can or else you drag it along reluctantly, grumbling, impatient and protesting. I seem to see in you the oxen that drew the Ark of the Covenant against their will, bellowing as they went, unaware that what they were drawing contained the most precious treasure upon earth.

Make no mistake about it; since incarnate Wisdom had to enter heaven by the Cross, you also must enter by the same way. No matter which way you turn, says the Imitation of Christ, you will always find the Cross. Like the elect you may take it up rightly, with patience and cheerfulness out of love for God; or else like the reprobate you may carry it impatiently and unwillingly as those doubly unfortunate ones who are constrained to repeat perpetually in hell, “We have labored and suffered in the world and after it all, here we are with the damned.” (Wis 5.7)

Let us listen to the voice of Wisdom himself: “Seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you, ask and it shall be given you.” (Mt 7.7; Lk 11.9) It is as if he said: If you wish to find me, you must seek me; if you wish to enter my palace, you must knock at my door; If you wish to receive me, you must ask for me. Nobody finds me unless he searches for me; nobody enters my house unless he knocks at my door; nobody possesses me unless he asks for me. We can only do this by prayer.

If we would possess Wisdom, we must mortify the body, not only by enduring patiently our bodily ailments, the inconveniences of the weather and the difficulties arising from other people’s actions, but also by deliberately undertaking some penances and mortifications, such as fasts, vigils and other austerities practiced by holy penitents.

For exterior and voluntary mortification to be profitable, it must be accompanied by the mortifying of the judgment and the will through holy obedience, because without this obedience all mortification is spoiled by self-will and often becomes more pleasing to the devil than to God. That is why no exceptional mortification should be undertaken without seeking counsel.

Mary is also mistress of divine Wisdom. Not that she is above him who is truly God, or even equal to him. To think or say such a thing would be blasphemous. But because the Son of God, Eternal Wisdom, by making himself entirely subject to her as his Mother, gave her a maternal and natural authority over himself which surpasses our understanding. He not only gave her this power while he lived on earth but still gives it now in heaven, because glory does not destroy nature but makes it perfect. And so in heaven Jesus is as much as ever the Son of Mary, and Mary the Mother of Jesus.

This means that Mary by her powerful prayers and because she is the Mother of God, obtains from Jesus all she wishes. It means that she gives him to whom she decides, and produces him every day in the souls of those she chooses.

What then can we do to make our hearts worthy of him? Here is the great way, the wonderful secret. Let us, so to speak, bring Mary into our abode by consecrating ourselves unreservedly to her as servants and slaves. Let us surrender into her hands all we possess, even what we value most highly, keeping nothing for ourselves. This good mistress who never allows herself to be surpassed in generosity will give herself to us in a real but indefinable manner; and it is in her that Eternal Wisdom will come and settle as on a throne of splendor.

Mary is wise: let us place everything in her hands. She knows how to dispose of us and all that we have for the greater glory of God. Mary is charitable: she loves us as her children and servants. Let us offer everything to her and we will lose nothing by it; she will turn everything to our gain. Mary is liberal: she returns more than we give her. Let us give her unreservedly all that we own without any reservation; she will give us a hundredfold in return. Mary is powerful: nothing on earth can take from her what we have placed in her keeping. Let us then commit ourselves to her care; she will defend us against our enemies and help us to triumph over them. Mary is faithful: she will not permit anything we give her to be lost or wasted. She stands alone as the Virgin most faithful to God and to men. She faithfully guarded and kept all that God entrusted to her, never allowing the least bit to be lost; and she still keeps watch every day, with a special care, over all those who have placed themselves entirely under her protection and guidance.

Only in the flesh, not in the bare spirit, can destiny and history come into being; this is a fact to which we shall often return. God descended to us in the person of the Savior, Redeemer, in order to have a destiny, to become history. Through the Incarnation, the founder of the new history stepped into our midst. With his coming, all that had been before fell into its historical place “before the birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ,” anticipating or preparing for that hour; all that was to be, faced the fundamental choice between acceptance and rejection of the Incarnation. He “dwelt among us,” “pitched his tent among us,” as one translation words it. “Tent” of the Logos—what is this but Christ’s body: God’s holy pavilion among men, the original tabernacle of the Lord in our Midst, the “temple” Jesus meant when he said to the Pharisees: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (John 2:19).

The restoration of reason presupposes the restoration of love, and we can only love what we know because we have first touched, tasted, smelled, heard and seen. From that encounter with exterior reality, interior responses naturally arise, movements motivating, urging, releasing energies, infinitely greater than atoms, of intelligence and will. Without these motives, thought and action are aimless, sometimes random, more frequently mechanical, having an order but a tyrannical order, that is, an order imposed from without. Christian culture is the natural environment of truth, assisted by art, ordered intrinsically–that is, from within–to the praise, reverence and service of God Our Lord. To restore it, we must learn its language.

What is Christian Culture? It is essentially the Mass. That is not my or anyone’s opinion or theory or wish but the central fact of two thousand years of history. Christendom, what secularists call Western Civilization, is the Mass and the paraphernalia which protect and facilitate it. All architecture, art, political and social forms, economics, the way people live and feel and think, music, literature–all these things when they are right, are ways of fostering and protecting the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.

You often hear it said that television is neither good nor bad; it is an instrument like a gun, morally dependent on the motive for using it, not as the moralists say per se evil but only accidentally so, which is true; but concrete situations are per se accidental! There is a mean between per se and accidental called the determinant, which means what happens so many times and/or so intensely as to determine an outcome. It is usually the general, as opposed to the universal on the one hand and the particular on the other, which determines; but sometimes the determinant factor is a minority or even, though very rarely, a single case.

But she was capable of something which on earth is more than understanding, something possible only through that same divine power which, when the hour has come, grants understanding: faith. She believed, and at a time when in the fullest sense of the word probably no one believed. “And blessed is she who has believed. . . .” If anything voices Mary’s greatness, it is this cry of her cousin Elizabeth.

this journey of God from the everlasting into the transitory, this stride across the border into history, is something no human intellect can altogether grasp. The mind might even oppose the apparently fortuitous, human aspect of this interpretation with its own ‘purer’ idea of godliness; yet precisely here lies hidden the kernel of Christianity. Before such an unheard of thought the intellect bogs down. Once at this point a friend gave me a clue that helped my understanding more than any measure of bare reason. He said: “But love does such things!” Again and again these words have come to the rescue when the mind has stopped short at some intellectual impasse. Not that they explain anything to the intelligence; they arouse the heart, enabling it to feel its way into the secrecy of God. The mystery is not understood, but it does move nearer, and the danger of “scandal” disappears.

None of the great things in human life springs from the intellect; every one of them issues from the heart and its love. If even human love has its own reasoning, comprehensible only to the heart that is open to it, how much truer must this be of God’s love! When it is the depth and power of God that stirs, is there anything of which love is incapable? The glory of it is so overwhelming that to all who do not accept love as an absolute point of departure, its manifestations must seem the most senseless folly.

Those who live for pleasure, delighted by the attractive package, throw the gift away–in this instance of sex, the great gift of life itself.

It has been claimed that John did this for the sake of his disciples, that they might hear the confirmation from Jesus’ own lips. Possibly this is true; but it is also possible that John sent to Jesus for his own sake. If he did, it would by no means conflict with his calling. Often, naively, we imagine the illumination of a prophet as a fixed thing, as though he had only to behold, once, in order to know without wavering forever after; as though once gripped by the Spirit, he stood fast for all time. In reality even a prophet’s life is shaken by all storms and saddled with all weaknesses. At times the Spirit hoists him far above the heights of human accomplishment or being; then he beholds, drawing from his vision the power to unhinge history. At other times, the Spirit drops him, and back he plunges headlong into darkness and impotency, like Elias in the desert when he flung himself down beneath a bush and begged for death. (No more moving and powerful picture of the essence and destiny of the prophetic life exists than that found in the seventeenth to nineteenth chapters of the first Book of Kings.) Perhaps John did ask for his own sake; if this is true, what agonizing hours must have shaped that message to Jesus!

Simultaneously, another, a psychic process takes place: the body becomes more supple, the spirit freer. Everything seems to grow lighter, detached. The burden of gravity itself grows less perceptible. The limits of reality begin to withdraw; the field of the possible to widen as the spirit takes things in hand. The enlightened conscience registers with greater sensitivity and power, and the will becomes increasingly decisive. The protective mechanisms of human nature which shield man from the hidden, threatening realms of existence beneath, above, and beyond him begin to fall away. The soul stands stripped, open to all forces. Consciousness of spiritual power increases, and the danger of overstepping the set limits of human existence, of confusing its dignity and its possibilities, grows acute: danger of presumption and magic, general vertigo of the spirit. When a deeply religious person undergoes these processes his soul can become involved in crises of extreme gravity and danger.

The answer lies where it always has, not in the laws of nations, which indeed determine the destinies of Sodom and Gomorrah; the answer lies in the laws of the Kingdom within us because there we make the choice. There we are not the slaves of instruments but only of our own bad habits which have demanded the instruments–slaves of our lust for sex, money, power, pleasure and inanition.

The immediate, proximate and final purposes of all our operations can be summed up in three words: work, prayer, sacrifice. These are the items on the Catholic Agenda. And every time we pray the Hail Mary, we refer to them in the closing phrase: “Pray for us sinners now,” which is the immediate work to be done, “and at the hour of our death,” which is the proximate prayer to be said, because prayer is always a kind of dying, dying to selfishness; and last we say, “Amen,” which is sacrifice.

Those who speak to me, whose words I read; those with whom I associate or would like to associate; the people who give or withhold, who help or hinder me; people I love or influence or to whom I am bound by duty—these rule in me. God counts only when people permit him to, when they and their demands leave me time for him. God rules only in spite of people; when under their influence I am not too strongly tempted to feel that he does not exist at all. He reigns only inasmuch as consciousness of his presence is able to force itself upon me, to coexist with the people in my life. . . . Things also rule in me: things I desire, by the power of that desire; things that bother me, by their bothersomeness; things I encounter wherever I go, by the attraction they have for me or by the attention which they demand.

Where this is so, there is the kingdom of God. But with us it is the kingdom of people, kingdom of things, kingdom of earthly powers and events and arrangements and interests. They stifle God, crowd him out of our lives. Only in the pauses of our existence, or on its fringes, do they allow him to come into his own. Who can understand how God can be what he is, how everything that is has its being through him alone (so much so, that were he to withdraw his hand, it would dissolve like a shadow in the sun), yet that I, who am nothing in myself, who exist only as he made me, a symbol or image of my Maker, can be so ignorant of him? How is this possible that the tree in the road is more real to me than he? That God remains but a word to me? That he does not stream overpoweringly into my heart and consciousness?

Anointment means the permeating of the whole being with the sanctifying power of the Spirit; it is that seizure, setting apart, and “sealing” of a person by which the Lord makes him his servant and delegate: his prophet, priest or king.

At the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, Christ Himself speaks the words of consecration through the voluntary suicide of the priest’s own personality; the priest becomes the “persona,” the instrument through which a sound is voiced; and Christ, not the priest, says Hoc est Corpus Meum. And that Body is lifted up in silence; the bell is the strike of silence; in a noisy world it takes a striking sound within whose widening circles noise is hollowed out. And then He says, Hic est Calix Sanguinis Mei. In the Garden of Gethsemane He had prayed: If it is possible, let this chalice pass from Me. And now He says, This is the Chalice of My Blood. As we know, it is in the second part of the double act of the Consecration that the Blood of Christ is made present on the altar, separate from His Body, which is the reenactment of the shedding of His Blood at the Crucifixion.

But Christ does not stand by, a noble taskmaster, urging us to climb by ourselves heights far beyond our strength. What he desires for us is the supernatural life of the children of God. As long as we think from the worldly standpoint, this is of course out of our reach. But Christ says: “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Matt. 19:26). He shows us that God not only demands this of us, but that he gives us his own understanding, his own strength, thus enabling us to accomplish his demands. We must accept this on faith. When the mind cries: But that is impossible! faith replies: It is possible! Our faith is “the victory that overcomes the world” (I John 5:4).

What does the act of swearing under oath actually mean? That what I say is true, so true that I make God my witness. It is as true as God’s existence, as his truth. He who swears thus brings God into his statement. He couples his truth with that of God and demands that God vouch for it. Jesus says: How dare you?

Man is incapable of justice as long as he aims solely at justice. True justice can be obtained only from above, from a vantage point higher than itself. Man invariably metes out injustice when he tries to distribute a certain measured amount of justice.

We are invited to participate in the sanctity of him whose omnipotence and holiness are contained in the pure freedom of love; hence, of one who stands above good and evil, just and unjust. Truly, this is no longer a question of mere ethics—ethics which made such demands would be immoral—but of faith, of self-surrender to a command that is simultaneously a promise, promise of grace, without which all hope of fulfillment would be futile.

Jesus’ idea of reward is a warning-call to humility. He says: You man—with all your possibilities of perceiving and desiring good—you are nevertheless creature! With all your possibilities of free choice, you remain creature! Anselm of Canterbury wrote of this moral danger. The almost illimitable possibilities of free choice tempt man to omnipotence without God, to feel himself God’s equal. It can be overcome by reminding ourselves that even in the practice of virtue we are subject to God’s judgment. The fruit of the good deed (of the moral decision and the effort spent on performing it) does not follow autonomously, but is God-given as “reward.”

The idea of reward can be undignified, but only when coupled with a false conception of God. The God of whom Jesus speaks is he who urges me to love him by enabling me to love with his divine power. It is from him that I receive both the love necessary for my act and its “reward”: his esteem, itself love. As genuine love grows it begins to say: I love God because he is God. I love him because he is worthy to be who he is. I wish my act to affirm him to whom the multitudes of the angels cry: “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and divinity and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing” (Apoc. 5:12). And suddenly all thought of reward has vanished. No, it is still present in the humility of the beginning, but vanished as a direct motive, and that to which autonomous virtue aspired but could not attain unaided is accomplished: pure good for its own holy sake. Never has purity of intent been more exalted than in the bearing of the saints, who completely overlooked themselves in their burning desire to be possessed by God for God’s sake. Only by not aspiring to that purity which is his alone, were they able to avoid running amuck in delusion and pride.

Seen from the cosmic point of view, we actually appear so, and it is often difficult to rid ourselves of the feeling that any other conception is illusory. But in events like those just described, the perspective shifts. It becomes evident that for God those mites on the grain of sand lost in immeasurable space are more important than the Milky Way or the whole universe; that the short span of time in which life endures on earth is more important than all the light years of astronomy. The few years of human existence, the ten years of solitude that a widow perhaps has before her, weigh more in God’s eyes than all the aeons that solar systems require to evolve and decline. God would never sacrifice a single human heart for the preservation of Sirius or the Andromadae, yet when his holy omniscience confronts human suffering incapable of recognizing its hidden significance any other way, he commands natural law to a higher service than that to which it would be capable alone. And it is well that this is so, and significant—also from the standpoint of natural law, provided that it is grasped realistically and not made a fetish.

For Jesus there is more than the mere possibility of evil as the price of human freedom; more than the inclination to evil, fruit of individual or collective (inherited) sin. Jesus recognizes a personal power that fundamentally wills evil: evil per se. It is not satisfied by the achievement of positive values through wicked means; does not simply accept the evil along with the good. Here is something or someone who positively defies divinity and attempts to tear the world from God’s hands—even to dethrone God. God being who he is, this is possible only by leading the world into apostasy and self-destruction.

“Therefore I say to you, that every kind of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven . . . either in this world or in the world to come” (Matt. 12:30–32). What has happened? These men have blasphemed against the Holy Ghost. Not only have they turned against God and his dominion; not only against the person, word and deed of Christ, but against the very heart of God. They have falsified his relationship to himself and to mankind, degraded his sacred intentions. Let us think for a moment in earthly terms. A man hurts his friend: he has been inconsiderate, or has misjudged him, or walked roughshod over some sensitive spot, or whatever the trouble may be. Any one of these things can upset a friendship, the extent of the damage depending on the degree of the carelessness or the importance of the dispute. However, something totally different would occur should the man attack not only the work, the words, the conduct of his friend, but his very character. If he were to say: Your motives are impure; you are entirely false and wicked! Such an accusation would necessarily shatter the friendship. Something similar happens here. Jesus is saturated with the essence of God. To accuse him of working through the power of Satan, is to touch the absolute in ill will. Only the man whose spirit has consented to darkness can speak thus. Here forgiveness is impossible because a state has been reached which lies outside the domain of man’s earthly experience: that of ultimate petrifaction in evil.

Again, were one to say: Forgiveness means that I remain a sinner, but that God in his magnanimity attributes me with sanctity, thus giving me a share of his own unimaginable divine grace, the thought would be so complicated and so full of reservations that it would be untenable with the meaning of Scriptures. Forgiveness also does not mean that God gives me the strength never to repeat my sin. Even if this were so, my old sin would still be there; forgiveness could never spirit it away. That would be deceitful and impure. How could God’s immaculateness ever reconcile itself to such a thought? What possibility then does exist?

Genuine forgiveness is as far superior to creation, as love is to justice, and if the mystery of creation out of nothing is already impenetrable, all human concepts are completely lost when faced with the mystery of God’s power to render a sinner sinless. Such creative power emanates from the pure liberty of love. Between the states of sinfulness and sinlessness lies a death, a destruction in which the sinner is submerged, in order to be lifted from it into a new existence.

How do I know that this is possible? Because he who has “seen,” who “has come down from heaven” warrants for it. You must take him at his word. But what if I am not that far, if I haven’t yet such trust? Then you must wait and pray, if only to say: Lord, if you are he whom Scripture names, let me know you! Christ is our guarantor. Our part is simply to let go. Confidence in our own understanding, purity of attitude, excellence of personal effort, faithfulness to character, the sterling quality of the historical or cultural elements of the past—all this has been preparatory and important. But now the moment has come to put it aside. To become a Christian means to go to Christ on the strength of his word alone; to trust solely in his testimony. Blind acceptance of what remains unclear, unreasonable is part of this step and belongs essentially to the “foolishness” of the crossing over (I Cor. 1:23).

Thus when fear or dislike moves us to avoid him, this reaction is already evident in our gaze; the eye caricaturizes him, stifling the good, heightening the bad.

Thus when fear or dislike moves us to avoid him, this reaction is already evident in our gaze; the eye caricaturizes him, stifling the good, heightening the bad. We discern his intentions, make swift comparisons, and leap to conclusions. All this proceeds involuntarily, if not unconsciously (in which case our powers of distortion, uncurbed by reason, do their worst). Seeing is a protective service to the will to live. The deeper our fear or distaste of a person, the more tightly we close our eyes to him, until finally we are incapable of perception or the profound German word for it, Wahrnehmen: reception-of-truth. Then we have become blind to that particular person. This mysterious process lies behind every enmity. Discussion, preaching, explanations are utterly useless. The eye simply ceases to register what is plain to be seen. Before there can be any change, a fundamental shift must take place in the general attitude. The mind must turn to justice, the heart expand; then only can the eye really begin to discern.

It is also said that the sheep heed the Shepherd, because they know his voice. Is it true that men recognize Christ’s call and respond to it? In one sense it must be, for he has said so; yet much in me qualifies the statement. Actually I respond much more readily to the call of ‘the others’; I neither really understand Christ’s summons nor follow it. Therefore, in order that I may hear, he must not only speak, but also open my ears to his voice. Part of me, the profoundest part, listens to it, but superficial, loud contradiction often overpowers it. The opponents with whom God must struggle in order to win us are not primarily ‘the others,’ but ourselves; we bar his way. The wolf who puts the hireling to flight is not only outside; he is also within. We are the arch-enemy of our own salvation, and the Shepherd must fight first of all with us—for us.

God’s word is a command that brings with it the possibility of obeying. It creates its own “acceptable time.” The hour rejected not only vanishes, but trails a wake of disaster. The point is a delicate one and we make it reluctantly, but the text must be interpreted. What have we ourselves done with the all-decisive opportunity? Painfully aware that the words are there for us too, we can only place ourselves under judgment, begging God to be patient. For the heart from which the rejected word turns, remains not only empty, but also hardened. Its owner settles down for good in the world; he may be efficient, clever, noble, almost anything, but he is closed to Christ’s tidings. “For what does it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, but suffer the loss of his own soul?” (Matt. 16:26).

And there was another who said, “ ‘I will follow thee, Lord; but let me first bid farewell to those at home.’ Jesus said to him, ‘No one, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God’ ” (Luke 9:61–2). Jesus seems to see that the man is sincere but weak. Actually, the wish to arrange his affairs at home is more than justified; but perhaps Jesus sees in it a threat to the decision just made; once back in his accustomed environment, this man may be unable to keep his resolution. So the Master faces him with his now-or-never. He who hesitates even for a moment to answer God’s call is lost.

And for large numbers of Catholics today, not only the theology of St. Thomas, but the Faith itself has become a superstition. We give assent without belief, because belief supposes some degree of understanding. Faith, like science, without intelligence is magic. Many–most, under a certain age–at Mass now have little understanding of the greatest act in the universe, before which the angels bend their knees; with the loss of culture and the help of liturgists, most Catholics see it now primarily as a way of sharing the presence of Christ in each other, especially through a parody of the Benedictine kiss of peace.

Peter says: “Lord, if it is thou, bid me come to thee over the water.” What do the words reveal? The desire for proof, and we admire the boldness of that desire, for if it is a ghost that stands there, the proving will be fatal; it is also evidence of faith, for Peter does believe. And finally, it is an example of that great, undaunted will to union with Christ which is the apostle’s profoundest trait. So Jesus calls: Come! Peter, his eyes deep in the eyes of the Lord, steps overboard and sets his foot upon a wave. The water bears his weight. He believes, and his faith lifts him to the circuit of that power which flows from Christ. Christ himself does not “believe,” he simply is who he is, God’s Son. To believe means to share not what Christ believes, but what he is.

The life of faith demands a revolution in our sense of reality. In our consciousness, which is not only entangled, but completely befuddled by the world, the body is more ‘real’ than the soul; electricity more real than thought; power more real than love; utility more real than truth. Together they form “the world”—incomparably more real than God. How difficult it is even in prayer to sense the reality of God! How difficult, and how seldom given us, the grace of contemplation in which Christ is more tangibly, powerfully present than the things of existence! And then to rise, to mix with people, perform the duties of the day, feel the tug of environment and public life and still to say, God is more real than all this, Christ more powerful, to say this spontaneously, absolutely convinced that it is so, how many can do this?

How is it that God permeates the universe, that everything that is comes from his hand, that every thought and emotion we have has significance only in him, yet we are neither shaken nor inflamed by the reality of his presence, but able to live as though he did not exist? How is this truly satanic deceit possible? Here in this mystery of the ‘impotence’ of God lies that special element we have already mentioned. It is this ultimate, terrible concentration of God’s insistence on human freedom, however tragic its effects, with which St. John opens his Gospel: “In him was life, and the life was the light of men.

What then is really the Incarnation? It is the fulfillment of revelation, in which the unknown God makes himself known, the remote God suddenly steps into human history. Incarnation is literally what the word says: the living, actual Word of God, the Logos, Son in whom all the mystery of the Father is gathered, becomes man through the Holy Ghost. Do we see the essential now? Becomes man—not “enters into” a man. The Heavenly One is translated to the earthly scene; the Remote One becomes temporal reality. “And he who sees me” need no longer guess; he “sees him who sent me” (John 12:45).

The child, on the other hand, does not yet have the instinct of self-preservation—at least not nearly so strongly; he lives in a world of unruffled trust. This attitude is no credit to him, for it springs from ignorance rather than virtue; nevertheless, it is there, and engenders an unconscious courage toward existence.

Jesus means nothing sentimental or touching; neither sweet defenselessness nor gentle malleability. What he values is the child’s clarity of vision; the ability to look up and out, to feel and accept reality without ulterior motives. Fundamentally, the attitude of the child is precisely the attitude suggested by the word “believer”: the natural attitude of a faith which is open to all that comes from God and ready to accept the consequences. In other words, something great and holy, and clearly not to be had for the asking. Not for nothing does the text read: “. . . unless you turn and become as little children . . .” unless you outgrow maturity, turn back to the beginning and build from the ground up. . . . This is a long and difficult process.

Blessing is directed to living things. Inanimate things have their fixed measure; they remain as they are. Animate things though, contain a secret source from which flows the mystery of beginning. They grow and multiply. It is to this mystery of increase that blessing is applied: increase in the vitality of body and spirit, as proved by their fruits. Blessing stirs inner depths, unsealing some hidden spring. It can be applied to everything that has immanent life. Malediction is barrenness. It chills and closes, renders life inanimate and sterile: the cursed womb does not bear; the cursed field runs to weed; the cursed singer finds no new song.

Why did Jesus come? To add a new, higher value to those already existent? To reveal a new truth over and above existing truth, or a nobler nobility, or a new and juster order of human society? No, he came to bring home the terrible fact that everything, great and small, noble and mean, the whole with all its parts—from the corporal to the spiritual, from the sexual to the highest creative urge of genius—is intrinsically corrupt. This does not deny the existence of individual worth. What is good remains good, and high aspirations will always remain high. Nevertheless, human existence in toto has fallen away from God. Christ did not come to renew this part or that, or to disclose greater human possibilities, but to open man’s eyes to what the world and human life as an entity really is; to give him a point of departure from which he can begin all over with his scale of values and with himself. Jesus does not uncover hidden creative powers in man; he refers him to God, center and source of all power.

What must we overcome in ourselves to be capable of genuine forgiveness? First of all, deep in the domain of the purely natural, the sentiment of having to do with an enemy. This sense of the hostile is something animals have, and it reaches as far as their vulnerability. Creatures are so ordered that the preservation of the one depends on the destruction of the other. This is also true of fallen man, deeply enmeshed in the struggle for existence. He who injures me or takes something valuable from me is my enemy, and all my reactions of distrust, fear, and repulsion rise up against him. I try to protect myself from him, and am able to do this best by constantly reminding myself of his dangerousness, instinctively mistrusting him, and being prepared at all times to strike back. . . . Here forgiveness would mean first that I relinquish the clear and apparently only sure defense of natural animosity; second, that I overcome fear and risk defenselessness, convinced that the enemy can do nothing against my intrinsic self. Naturally, this does not mean that I close my eyes to danger, and it is self-understood that I do everything in my power to protect myself: I must be watchful and resolute. But the crux of the matter is forgiveness, a profound and weighty thing. Its prerequisite is the courage that springs from a deep sense of intimate security, and which, as experience has proved, is usually justified, for the genuine pardoner actually is stronger than the fear-ridden hater.

The desire for revenge is slightly more ‘human.’ It is not a response to mortal danger, but to the danger of loss of power and honor. The fact that the other was able to damage me proves that he was stronger than I; had I been what I should be, he never would have dared to attempt it. The impulse to retaliate aims primarily at reestablishing my self-respect by humiliating my enemy. I would rise by the other’s fall. . . . To forgive him would mean to renounce this satisfaction, and necessitates a self-respect independent of the behavior of others because it lives from an intrinsic honor that is invulnerable. Again experience has shown that such an attitude also better protects my reputation, for my freedom blunts the point of the insult, thus disarming the aggressor.

When you begin to pray, says the Lord, and suddenly remember that you have a grudge against someone, forgive him first! If you do not, your unforgiveness will step between you and the Father and prevent your request from reaching him. This does not mean that God forgives us because kindness to our neighbors renders us ‘worthy’ of his generosity. His pardon is pure grace, which is not founded on our worthiness, but creates it. A priori, however, is the opening of the heart for divine magnanimity: our readiness to forgive “our debtors.” If we close it instead, we shut God’s forgiveness out.

When the Messiah, towards whom its whole history has been directed, finally arrives, Israel fails to understand the hour of its ultimate visitation “because thou hast not known the time” of salvation or “the things that are for thy peace,” and achieves instead the fullness of disobedience.

Why must the Son of God die before he is comprehended? Why can’t his living presence be understood? No, the “must” and “can’t” and his own “it is expedient for you” cannot be explained away by psychology, for they are part of that dark mystery mentioned in the first chapter of John’s gospel. Jesus was not recognized because men had shut themselves up in darkness. And if we understand rightly, it is added that the darkness took possession also of hearts desirous of knowing him. Even the Apostles were so constituted that Christ’s spirit could not come to them directly, but for some inexplicable reason, Christ first had to pass through death.

That Jesus’ task “is consummated” must be true, because he says so (John 19:30). Yet what a spectacle of failure! His word rejected, his message misunderstood, his commands ignored. None the less, the appointed task is accomplished, through obedience to the death—that obedience whose purity counterbalances the sins of a world. That Jesus delivered his message is what counts—not the world’s reaction; and once proclaimed, that message can never be silenced, but will knock on men’s hearts to the last day. Once introduced, the eternal kingdom, too, remains forever “at hand,” ready to enter into time wherever faith opens a door, for Christ is “the way, and the truth, and the life” (Matt. 3:2; John 14:6). Jesus’ coming changed the world. From now on it is and will remain the world in which Christ stands. Through this accomplishment the Father has been glorified.

He is really the Seer among the blind, sole sensitive one among beings who have lost their touch, the only free and self-possessed one in the midst of general confusion. Jesus’ consciousness of the world’s corruption is not grounded in the world and therefore prisoner of existence.

Only Christ’s love is certain. We cannot even say God’s love; for that God loves us we also know, ultimately, only through Christ. And even if we did know without Christ that God loved us—love can also be inexorable, and the more noble it is, the more demanding. Only through Christ do we know that God’s love is forgiving. Certain is only that which manifested itself on the cross. What has been said so often and so inadequately is true: The heart of Jesus Christ is the beginning and end of all things.

Were we not also among those in Capharnaum who protested: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” (John 6:53)? Why these strange words about the flesh and blood of Christ—why not “the truth” and “the love” of Jesus? Why not leave it at the first half of the promise in John six; are the tangible, if not material details, the eating of flesh and drinking of blood really necessary? Wouldn’t remembrance of the Lord in all the purity and dignity of the spirit suffice? Why not? Because not only the spirit of Christ, but his resurrected flesh and blood, his whole, transfigured humanity is redemption!

For the most part, man is absorbed by corporal, psychological, sociological realities; in other words, by public things. But there are certain moments when he retires into a corner of his being that is closed to others—into his most personal self. No one can violate that privacy; if it is to be opened, then only by opening itself. This is what happens in love, when a person not only permits himself to be observed, not only speaks about himself, but gives himself in vital exchange. If the other accepts him, likewise opening the way to his most intimate self, desiring the other more than himself, entering into pure contemplation and exchange, then the two intimacies unite in a single community open to both participants, but closed to everyone else.

Peter does not speak about Jesus, but from him. Because his relationship to the Lord is different from what it was, he himself is different. The questioning, self-surrendering seeker has become the proclaiming believer. How? Not by reflection, or private experience; not because after days of confusion and terror he has himself again under control, but because the Holy Spirit prophesied by Christ has literally received “of what is mine” and declared it “to you” (John 16:15).

He who has no immediate contact with her will never grasp her meaning. He may be a master in the natural sciences, of nature herself he will know nothing. Who understands music? He who has music in him. It is the same, only more so, with Christ. Only he can understand Christ who lives in that which comes from Christ.

the spiritual man is capable of understanding the world because he lives ‘above’ the world—thanks to the redemption of Christ and the roots that he has in Christ’s freedom. Thus he gains a distance from the things of the world that no one rooted in it can gain—not even the most gifted. He inhabits a sphere detached, that of salvation established by the birth and death of Christ.

If baptism means that the divine beginning is made in us, to become Christian means that we fulfill the promise of that beginning: that we reconsider all things in Christ; that we penetrate more and more deeply into his point of view; that our life is remodelled after his. Who dares to boast that this is so? One does not ‘believe’ from a distance. One cannot consider Christ and his teachings and decide to join forces with him, cross over to him. He must come and fetch us. We must ask him to send his Spirit that we may come to him. We must ‘let go,’ confident that he will catch us up into his love and draw us to him. If we honestly think and hope thus, we already have the beginning for which we hoped, for even the hope that he will help us to believe is possible only when he has somehow already granted it.

God is the One of whom it can be said, that the more powerfully he activates an individual, and the more completely he penetrates his being, the more clearly that individual attains his own inherent personality. Seemingly a contradiction, actually this is the ultimate expression of the divine essence. For God is by no means “Another.” It is not at all as if he stood opposite, and I had to choose between him or me. On the contrary, all that I am, I am through him. The more intensively he directs his creative powers upon me, the more real I become. The more he gives me of his love, the fuller my self-realization in that love. Christ is God in the pure, full sense of the word; the Logos through whom all things were created, myself included. Not until he inhabits me, do I become the being God meant me to be.

What makes a Christian Christian in everything he says and does is the living Christ in him; different in every individual and in every phase of that individual’s life. Different in joy and pain, in work and social intercourse, nonetheless, it is always Christ.

It suggests that its attitude towards life is the only valid one, and that the Christian point of view is but one variety of it. It removes the two poles of Christian existence: the one planted in divine sanctity, the other in the wilderness of sin.

She was the one who encompassed the Lord with all her being through His whole life, and in death as well. She was the one who had to experience Him, who came from God, growing ever further away from her. Time and again He raised Himself above her, and time and again, feeling the edge of the sword, she increased her faith to match His new stature, and encompassed Him anew — until at the end, He was no longer her Son.

Pero si como resultado se descuidase la oración por las vocaciones al sacramento, si aquí o allá la Iglesia comenzase a bastarse a sí misma y, podríamos decir, a volverse casi autónoma del don de Dios, se estaría comportando como Saúl, que presionado por los filisteos esperó largamente a Samuel, pero como tardó en aparecer y el pueblo comenzó a dispersarse, perdió la paciencia y ofreció él mismo el holocausto. A él, que pensó que dada la urgencia de la situación no podía actuar de otra manera y que no podía más que asumir él mismo la causa de Dios, le fue dicho que precisamente por eso había perdido todo: para Dios “la obediencia es mejor que el sacrificio” (cfr. 1 S 13, 8-14; 15, 22)»[48]. De ahí que sea necesaria mucha prudencia a la hora de plantearse la creación de «ministerios laicos». Corremos el riesgo de quitarle a Dios el sitio y de organizar la Iglesia de un modo exclusivamente humano. Hemos de tener el valor de perseverar en la oración por las vocaciones.

First of all, there is a truth, a reality upon which every order of existence depends. It is the fact that God alone is God and that man is His creature and image—that God is really God, not an anonymous principle of the universe, not a mere idea, not the mystery of existence, but He who is Himself the real and living one, Lord and Creator, and man is His creature and is obliged to obey the supreme Lord. This is the basic order of all earthly conditions and earthly activity. Against it, the first man rebelled when he let himself be persuaded that he might “be as God,”9 and this rebellion continues to the present day, on the part of great and small, genius and gabbler. But if this order is disturbed, then no matter how much power is gained, how much welfare secured, or how much culture developed, all things remain in chaos.

At any rate, truthfulness means that one tells the truth, not only once but again and again, so that it becomes a habit. It brings to the whole man, his being and his action, something clear and firm.

A truth that is spoken at the wrong moment or in a wrong way may so confuse a person that he has difficulty in getting his bearings again. That would not be a living truthfulness but a one-sided one, damaging and destructive. Of course, there are moments when one must not look to the right or left, but state the plain truth. But, as a rule, it holds good that we are in the context of existence, and here consideration for the other person is as important as truth-telling. Therefore truth-telling, in order to attain its full human value, must be accompanied by tact and kindness.

Here, too, the living quality of truth is endangered, for it includes the liberty of spirit to see what is true, the determination of responsibility which upholds its judgment even in the face of sympathy and helpfulness, and the strength of personality which understands that its own dignity stands or falls with its loyalty to truth. So we have two elements which must accompany the desire for truth if the complete virtue is to develop: consideration for the person addressed and courage when truth-telling becomes difficult.

So the truth of the word becomes ever more important. This is applicable to every kind of relationship—above all to those upon which life in the proper sense depends: friendship, collaboration, love, marriage, and the family. Associations that are to endure, to grow, and to become fruitful must become ever more pure in the truthfulness of each toward the other; if not, they will disintegrate. Every falsehood destroys the community.

This is also true in regard to that great power which penetrates the whole of man’s life and which is called “the state.” It is no accident that whenever the state, whose basic principles should be liberty and justice, becomes a tyranny, lying and falsehood grow proportionately. Even more, truth is deprived of its value; it ceases to be the norm and is replaced by success. Why? Because it is through truth that the spirit of man is constantly confirmed in its natural rights, and the person is reassured of his dignity and freedom. When a person says, “It is so,” and this statement has weight in public because truth is honored, then he is protected against the force inherent in every government. But if the government succeeds in depriving truth of its value, then the individual is helpless.

The most hideous manifestation of tyranny occurs when a man’s conscience and consciousness of truth are broken, so that he is no longer able to say, “This is so … this is not so.” Those who bring this about—in political and judicial affairs, or elsewhere—should realize clearly what they are doing: they are depriving man of his humanity. This realization would crush and destroy them.

Judgment means that the possibility of lying ceases because omnipotent truth penetrates every mind, illumines every word, and rules in every place. Then falsehood will be revealed as what it is.

Let us once more project ourselves imaginatively into what it must mean when a man is full of the profoundest insight into what is necessary for everyone’s salvation, full of the purest sort of love, ready to open his heart, to offer himself, and to be of help. And then he comes and speaks to one, and to another, and he encounters distrust here and incomprehension there, mocking laughter, and hostility — this is what Jesus had to go through.

Whosoever stands obedient to the love of Jesus enters into the mystery of the nearness which binds the Lord to the Father. And full of blessed overflowing fulfillment are those words: “We will both come to him, and make our continual abode with him.” Jesus lives in the presence of the Father. This proximity is brought about by the Father’s will and Jesus’ obedience. There is a unison of love in this nearness; and in this unison, there is joy and the most ineffable peace.

It is not just peace in general, not just some sort of harmony; it is the peace of Christ — that peace which cannot be given by any created thing; that peace which consists in the unity of love between Jesus and the Father, and in Jesus’ surrender to His Will. This peace is what the Father gives to anyone who opens himself to receive Him. In this fashion, the believer takes part in that unity.

If someone should ask, “How do I come to God? What kind of being is God?” this would be the answer: God is just as He manifested Himself in Jesus. Whoever looks upon Jesus, whoever takes into account who Jesus is, how He speaks, how He conducts Himself, what His attitudes are — such a one is perceiving God Himself. And he will get to God by going in Jesus’ company, allowing himself to be instructed by Him, and allowing himself to become centered in that identity with which he makes his approach to Jesus. Then he is indeed on the way, in truth, and he partakes of life.

More often than not, what passes as sacrifice for work or an idea is nothing but camouflaged assertion of status. Or a man may give his life for his nation, carried off by the dreadful events of war. Or he might do the same for his neighbor in peril, if he is driven by a great heart. But what about giving one’s life for mankind — for all the strangers afar off, for all those he encounters who have no sympathy or understanding or love for him, who accept nothing, and who even defend themselves against the salvation being offered them?

Blessed indeed are “those who have not seen, and yet have learned to believe.” Those who ask for no miracles, demand nothing out of the ordinary, but who find God’s message in everyday life. Those who require no compelling proofs, but who know that everything coming from God must remain in a certain ultimate suspense, so that faith may never cease to require daring. Those who know that the heart is not overcome by faith, that there is no force or violence there, compelling belief by rigid certitudes. What comes from God touches gently, comes quietly, does not disturb freedom, and leads to quiet, profound, peaceful resolve within the heart.

Perhaps it can be said that Heaven is on its way to us as long as we do not keep it at a distance by our own actions. I believe it is no fantasy or delusion to think this way: that our whole Christian life consists in having Heaven continually striving to catch up with us, close in on us. Every Christian act, belief, love, sacrifice, struggle, every perseverance and courageous performance — all these things make possible the approach of Him who desires only to come forward. But all coldness, indifference, slothfulness, weakness, pride, covetousness — everything that sin is called — forces Him back, bars the road to Him. And Heaven fights. Heaven wants to come to us. For Heaven is only God’s love come home.

Two persons have met, have fallen in love, and decide to marry. This relationship is at first supported by the desire of the one vitality for the other, feelings of congeniality, common experiences, harmony in relation to nature and men, similar preferences and inclinations, and so forth. These feelings at first seem to guarantee a life-long bond. But they can easily cease. Differences, such as we always find between different persons, appear. And now is the time for true loyalty: each of the two must be aware that the other trusts him, depends upon him, that they have formed a bond which determines their life, that this must be supported by what is best in them, the core of their humanity, the person and his dependability.

Loyalty overcomes change, injury, and danger, but not by a power of persistence inherent in one’s disposition. That may exist, and happy is the one who possesses it. But loyalty is more than that; it is the firmness which results when a man has assumed a responsibility and abides by it. This quality overcomes the variability, the injuries, and the dangers of life by the power of conscience. A person of this sort can be trusted. We feel that in him there is a point which is beyond fear and weakness, and which gives him ever-renewed strength to persevere in his resolve.

In this way, faith acquires a new meaning; it is the act by which man endures through the period of God’s silence and absence. When God lets us feel His nearness, when His word comes to life, then it is not difficult to be sure of His reality; it is joy. But when He conceals Himself, when we feel nothing and the sacred word is silent, then it becomes difficult. But this is the time for true faith.

In his associations with others, such a man does not turn toward another person with simplicity and sincerity, but he always has ulterior motives. He wishes to make an impression, to be envied, to gain an advantage, or to get ahead. He praises in order to be praised. He renders a service in order to be able to exact one in return.

There is another point that we must consider, something particularly pressing in times when historical epochs end and new ones begin. This is man’s relation to the future as a whole, to the course of history. The life of the individual does not flow along in the course of history like water in the bed of a stream; rather it forms a part of it. Sometimes the individual is so bound up with the past that the future is quite strange to him. Then he lives without confidence in the future and takes refuge in the past. What has been is so completely satisfactory to him and its form so fair, that all that is new repels him. Here, too, courage is necessary—courage which dares to face the future in the confidence that God’s plan will work out. This courage accepts what is to come, sees in it the individual’s own task, and cooperates. This may be very difficult and can be accomplished only by means of true obedience to the will of Him who guides history. Bravery

Every saint reflects in a particular way the Incarnation of God in Christ. In no longer seeking himself, he gives place to God, who makes him the person he really should be, as God’s essential Incarnation in Christ manifested what man as such, the “son of man” really is. Of course, the way thereto is a self-surrender, one sacrifice after another, the “painful death of self” as the spiritual masters call it.

He who has realized what a valuable thing it is to be recollected must overcome this tendency—or let us speak more modestly, must strive to overcome it more and more.

Only he who is also able to be silent can speak meaningfully; otherwise he talks nonsense. Only he who can also speak can properly keep silence; otherwise he is dumb. Man lives in these two mysteries; their unity expresses his nature.

To be capable of silence is a virtue. He who does not know how to keep silence does the same thing with his life as a man who would wish only to exhale and not to inhale. We need only imagine this to feel terrified. The man who is never silent dissipates his humanity.

The beginning of all religious life is the awareness that God is. He is not merely a feeling or an idea, but a reality. He is more real than I am myself; He is the essential, self-based, eternal reality, and all serious religious life leads to the experience that God is and we are only before Him and through Him. But God is not only real; He is “somebody,” Himself.

We must resist the endless chatter and noise that fills the world; we must struggle as an asthmatic person struggles for breath. Otherwise something in us withers and dies. But the external noise is only half the problem and perhaps not even the most difficult half. The other is the inner turmoil, the whirl of thoughts, the drive of desire, the restlessness and worries of the mind, the burden of care, the wall of dullness, or whatever it may be which fills our interior world as the rubble fills an abandoned well.

We must be serious about this. A life properly lived includes practice in silence. This begins with keeping our mouth shut whenever this is required by the confidence of another person, the duties of our vocation, tact, or respect for others. It goes on to include keeping silence at times even when it might be permissible to speak, especially if speaking would create an impression. Not to speak at such times is a good exercise in keeping our mastery over the inordinate desire to talk. We should strive to conquer the mania for constant chatter and idle talk. How many superfluous things we say in the course of the day—how many foolish things! We must learn that silence is beautiful, that it is not emptiness, but true and full life.

Existence is given to man so that he may take it with a sense of responsibility and use it rightly. It is not really given to him, but it is entrusted to him, just as the world was given to him in the form of a sacred trust, that he might “cultivate it and keep it.”

Ahora, pues, notad otro aviso: hácenos entender el demonio que tenemos una virtud, digamos de paciencia, porque nos determinamos y hacemos muy continuos actos de pasar mucho por Dios; y parécenos en hecho de verdad que lo sufriríamos, y así estamos muy contentas, porque ayuda el demonio a que lo creamos. Yo os aviso no hagáis caso de estas virtudes, ni pensemos las conocemos sino de nombre, ni que nos las ha dado el Señor, hasta que veamos la prueba; porque acaecerá que a una palabra que os digan a vuestro disgusto, vaya la paciencia por el suelo. Cuando muchas veces sufriereis, alabad a Dios que os comienza a enseñar esta virtud, y esforzaos a padecer, que es señal que en eso quiere se la paguéis, pues os la da, y no la tengáis sino como en depósito, como ya queda dicho (8).

En el orden sobrenatural Ella podrá aplicar a otras almas los valores secundarios de mis acciones, a saber el satisfactorio y el impetratorio, mientras que la gracia, las virtudes y los méritos propiamente dichos son por su propia naturaleza inaplicables a otros. Si la Santísima Virgen no puede comunicar estos valores sobrenaturales a otras personas, no se debe a la ineficacia o a la debilidad del derecho de propiedad que le reconozco sobre todo esto, sino a la naturaleza misma de lo que es objeto de este derecho.

Un esclavo de amor debe evitar por encima de todo el orgullo, por el que o bien se sobrestima a sí mismo y desprecia a los demás, o bien (lo cual es mucho más grave) se atribuye a sí mismo lo que corresponde a Dios, a quien debe atribuirse en definitiva todo honor y toda gloria. Hay que volver siempre a la gran y grave expresión del Apóstol: «¿Qué tienes que no hayas recibido? Y si lo has recibido, ¿por qué te glorías como si no lo hubieses recibido?» 197.

Un día, al encontrarme con una dirigente de obras sociales, me dijo: «Padre, nunca hago nada sin pedirle permiso a la Santísima Virgen. Nunca voy a la mesa sin pedirle: Madre, ¿puedo comer? Nunca salgo de casa sin decirle: Madre, ¿puedo hacer este recado, este paseo? Y lo mismo para todo lo demás». Eso es muy hermoso y perfecto, y es plenamente conforme al espíritu de nuestra dependencia interior de María. Eso es ser hijo de María. ¿Acaso los niños no piden consejo y permiso a su madre, o tratan al menos de leer en sus ojos la aprobación o desaprobación de la acción que se aprestan a realizar? Y los niños, como sabemos, son los más grandes en el reino de Dios.

Ordinariamente la respuesta de Nuestra Señora a estas preguntas, respuesta que Ella dará por la voz de la conciencia y por las inspiraciones de la gracia, será clara y neta. Aquí hay que ser leal, y no hacerse creer, por cobardía, por miedo del sacrificio y por amor de las comodidades, que María aprueba esta decisión, este acto, que Ella no puede de ningún modo considerar buenos. En las personas de sentido común y juicio recto este peligro no existe apenas. Y aunque de vez en cuando nos equivocásemos sobre algunos detalles, e imaginásemos que la Santísima Virgen nos dice «sí» cuando en realidad ha dicho «no», la cosa no sería tan grave, puesto que habitualmente obramos, no sólo subjetiva sino también objetivamente, según sus designios y voluntades.

En todo caso Nuestra Señora sabe, y ve en Dios, todo lo que nos rodea y todo lo que nos sucede. En todo esto Ella acepta los designios y la voluntad de la Providencia paterna y amorosa de Dios sobre nosotros. Ella quiere todo lo que quiere Dios, y asiente a todo lo que Dios permite. Por lo tanto, podemos decir que María dispone de nosotros y de todo lo que nos pertenece, al menos en el sentido de que Ella conoce, acepta y ratifica todas las disposiciones divinas relativas a nosotros. Hemos dicho, y debemos repetirlo a menudo: «Os dejo entero y pleno derecho de disponer de mí y de todo lo que me pertenece, sin excepción, según vuestro beneplácito…».

No somos lógicos con nuestras convicciones, no somos consecuentes con nuestro cristianismo. Somos cristianos por la Misa del domingo y una breve oración cotidiana. Los mejores lo son por la Misa, la sagrada Comunión y el Rosario de cada día. Pero nuestra vida de inteligencia, nuestra mentalidad, ¡están tan poco influenciadas por nuestras convicciones cristianas! En mil cosas pensamos y juzgamos exactamente como lo harían los paganos, los no bautizados. Demasiado a menudo juzgamos las personas y cosas, los acontecimientos e instituciones, como gente sensata y prudente tal vez, como gente advertida y perspicaz, como gente de negocios experimentada, es decir, según la sabiduría que se practica en el mundo. Pero precisamente «la sabiduría del mundo es locura ante Dios», escribe San Pablo 129. Y así, demasiado a menudo nuestros juicios son diametralmente opuestos a los de Cristo, el único en ser la Verdad, la Sabiduría y la Luz del mundo.

antes: son raros los cristianos que viven así. Muy a menudo, por desgracia, hacemos una selección en el Evangelio entre las prescripciones que nos caen bien y las que nos incomodan. Distinguimos demasiado lo que nos obliga bajo pena de pecado mortal o venial, para dejar de lado lo que pensamos —o así nos lo persuadimos— que no está prescrito bajo pena de pecado. Hemos truncado, alterado, minimizado, modernizado el Evangelio. ¡Somos una miniatura, y muchas veces, por desgracia, una caricatura de cristianos!

Le haré los favores que deseo me hagan a mí; evitaré con él lo que no me gustaría que me hagan a mí. Quiero soportar sus defectos, incluso los más incomprensibles, perdonar y olvidar todas sus faltas, incluso las más graves. No lo juzgaré ni condenaré; le concederé una buena y amplia medida de favores caritativos; lo trataré, sobre todo en la persona de los pobres, desgraciados y niños, como a Cristo mismo.

Y no seamos como tanta gente, como tantos cristianos por desgracia, que se someten con fervor mientras la autoridad se amolda a su manera de ver las cosas, mientras el obispo se conforma a sus miras, mientras el confesor se pliega a su parecer, pero que obran según sus caprichos, no hacen caso ni de decisiones ni de directivas de la autoridad, cuando estas no son a su gusto. Eso es sencillamente hacer siempre la voluntad propia, concuerde o no con la autoridad de Dios.

«el minuto de María» 180. Consiste en esto: antes de nuestras acciones principales, como la meditación, la santa Misa, la Comunión, los ejercicios de piedad, el trabajo, el recreo, etc., nos recogeremos profundamente durante algunos instantes para realizar apacible e intensamente los cuatro actos siguientes: 1º Humillarnos profundamente delante de Dios y de la Santísima Virgen a causa de nuestras faltas, de nuestra indignidad y de nuestra incapacidad para todo bien. 2º Renunciar, antes de comenzar esta acción, a todo lo que viniese puramente de nosotros, y por lo tanto, a nuestras propias miras y a nuestra propia voluntad. 3º Darnos totalmente a Nuestra Señora como su cosa y su propiedad, y como un instrumento dócil, del que Ella pueda servirse a su gusto, según su voluntad. 4º Pedirle humildemente que se digne obrar en nosotros, para que nuestras acciones no tiendan más que a la gloria de solo Dios. Esta es, incontestablemente, una fórmula integral de profunda vida espiritual y mariana, que puede llevarnos muy rápidamente a la dependencia interior y habitual para con Jesús y para con María.

This attitude contains a misapprehension. The man who pretends to love the good through the love of both his own dignity and his personal judgment concerning the good of his own personality, in reality does not love the good but rather adores himself and believes himself to be a god. If he truly loved the good he would certainly love even more than himself, and above everything else, the source of every good and of all justice, that is, the Good that is God. Pride is always something hard and cold. The person that more or less consciously refuses to humble himself, to obey, to rise above himself to the love of God is not able to find happiness, which does not, in fact, exist in any finite good. Perhaps this person recklessly spends himself in external works both for the pleasure of spreading his ideas and of dominating. One day or other this life has to end and for those lacking charity, death appears as something absurd that comes to destroy in an instant the moral edifice constructed with the efforts of a lifetime.

No mendigues entonces de las creaturas consuelo o diversión, pues lo echarías todo a perder y harías fracasar su obra divina de purificación y de desprendimiento. Cuando en la oración no encuentres más que aridez, distracciones y desgana, cuando tengas la impresión de que Jesús te rechaza, te condena y tal vez te maldice, has llegado a dos momentos cruciales de tu vida espiritual; el primero te hará aplicarte seriamente a la práctica de la perfección cristiana, el segundo te introducirá más adelante en los misterios del amor divino. Por desgracia, la experiencia nos enseña que la mayoría de las almas se dejan detener ahí. Esta es la razón por la que tan pocos cristianos alcanzan la vida de intimidad con Cristo, Esposo del alma: buscan su propia satisfacción, su propio gozo, aunque sea espiritual, en lugar de vivir de pura caridad por El.

eso. Es importante desde ahora atraer fuertemente la atención sobre una de sus características, sobre la cual deberemos volver más tarde. «El mundo es Satán disfrazado», escribe nuestro Padre de Montfort; «su principal padre es el demonio, aunque piense estar odiándolo». El mundo es el reino de Satán, pero construido sobre la mentira como fundamento. Habitualmente el demonio no se atreve a mostrarse como el espíritu de las tinieblas: se las da de ángel de luz. Difunde la mentira y el pecado bajo apariencia de verdad, de bien, sí, de virtud y santidad. El mundo es Satán, pero Satán enmascarado, disfrazado, y eso hace su acción mucho más peligrosa y temible.

Por lo tanto, salta a la vista que podríamos hablar de presencia espiritual entre dos seres, cuando estos dos seres caigan bajo el alcance mutuo de sus facultades de conocimiento espirituales, cuando estos dos seres puedan espiritualmente «verse», percibirse, cuando puedan contemplar y seguir mutuamente su actividad, incluso interior, lo que sería, evidentemente, algo mucho más precioso que verse, escucharse o tocarse por los sentidos, los ojos, los oídos o las manos.

Así, pues, el recurso a Nuestra Señora puede hacerse por medio de una oración formal interior o vocal. Puede hacerse también de manera más sencilla y fácil, y tal vez más perfecta: estableciéndose y manteniéndose en la disposición habitual de esperarlo todo de Ella, con la convicción absoluta de que Ella se encargará de todo.

Pero cuando el niño se siente en peligro, cuando una prueba dolorosa lo atenaza, en la enfermedad, en la angustia suprema, su madre es más que nunca su consuelo y su sostén. Que nuestra Madre del cielo deba ser para nosotros, sus hijos, el recurso seguro en las horas graves de lucha y de sufrimiento, se deduce claramente de las denominaciones consoladoras que la Iglesia ha dado a Nuestra Señora: Salud de los enfermos, Refugio de los pecadores, Consoladora

tengamos el cuidado de que a nuestro vía crucis no le falte la cuarta estación: el encuentro, en la confianza y el amor, con María, la santísima Madre de Jesús.

Y si nuestra vida se asemejase algún día a las últimas horas de Cristo en la Cruz, cuando desgarrado, torturado, lleno de fiebre, sediento, aborrecido y maldecido por sus enemigos, traicionado y abandonado por los suyos, se siente rechazado incluso por su Padre y deja escapar la desgarradora queja: «¡Dios mío, Dios mío!, ¿por qué me has desamparado?»; acordémonos entonces de que el Padre, que había privado a la divina Víctima de todo consuelo, le dejó la lenitiva presencia de su Madre amante, fiel y tan plenamente comprensiva del gran misterio… A nuestra humilde y ardiente oración la santísima Madre de Jesús, que es la nuestra, con incomparable afecto montará también una guardia fiel al pie de nuestra cruz, para que hasta el fin nos entreguemos con entero abandono a la crucificante pero amorosa voluntad del Padre, para nuestra perfección y santificación personal, y también para la irresistible conquista de las almas para el reino de amor de Cristo y de María.

En la vida del santo Cura de Ars, que también era esclavo de la Santísima Virgen, se cuenta un pequeño episodio típico del mismo género. Tenía quince o dieciséis años y trabajaba aún en la granja paterna. Tenía que layar el viñedo para eliminar las malas hierbas. Al parecer era un trabajo penoso. Para estimularse a ello, Juan María colocaba una estatuilla de la Santísima Virgen a unos veinte metros delante suyo. Para llegar más pronto junto a la imagen de su Madre, a la que tanto amaba, trabajaba entonces con redoblado ardor. De un modo u otro hagamos lo que hicieron los santos. Empleemos también estas piadosas estratagemas, recurramos a nuestro amor filial por María, a fin de superar nuestra debilidad. La experiencia demuestra que esta práctica encierra una grandísima energía para hacer el bien.

The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs.

Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specific instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version IS the past, and no different past can ever have existed.

Todo acontecimiento, toda persona, toda doctrina, las consideraré con los ojos de Cristo y de su divina Madre, los apreciaré según su manera de ver, y no según el parecer del mundo. Cuando tenga que formar un juicio, cuando otros me pidan mi parecer, entraré un instante en mí mismo y me preguntaré: ¿Qué piensan de este caso Jesús y María? ¿Qué piensan Ellos de la alegría y del sufrimiento, de la propiedad y de las privaciones, del éxito y de las humillaciones, de la paz y de la guerra, de operaciones de banco y de especulaciones en la bolsa, de la moda y del deporte, del cine y de las novelas…?

No somos lógicos con nuestras convicciones, no somos consecuentes con nuestro cristianismo. Somos cristianos por la Misa del domingo y una breve oración cotidiana. Los mejores lo son por la Misa, la sagrada Comunión y el Rosario de cada día. Pero nuestra vida de inteligencia, nuestra mentalidad, ¡están tan poco influenciadas por nuestras convicciones cristianas! En mil cosas pensamos y juzgamos exactamente como lo harían los paganos, los no bautizados. Demasiado a menudo juzgamos las personas y cosas, los acontecimientos e instituciones, como gente sensata y prudente tal vez, como gente advertida y perspicaz, como gente de negocios experimentada, es decir, según la sabiduría que se practica en el mundo. Pero precisamente «la sabiduría del mundo es locura ante Dios», escribe San Pablo 129. Y así, demasiado a menudo nuestros juicios son diametralmente opuestos a los de Cristo, el único en ser la Verdad, la Sabiduría y la Luz del mundo. Nunca, y por nada del mundo, hemos de aceptar juicio alguno contra las enseñanzas de Cristo.

Jesús dice también, y Nuestra Señora lo aprueba con toda su alma: «Bienaventurados los que lloráis ahora, porque reiréis… ¡Ay de los que reís ahora!, porque tendréis aflicción y llanto» 132. Y nosotros nos hemos ocupado sin cesar en huir de la cruz, y en sacudirla de nuestros hombros. Nos estimamos dichosos exactamente en la misma medida en que nos ahorramos algún sufrimiento. Huimos de las casas de luto y de tristeza, y buscamos la compañía de personas alegres, graciosas, ingeniosas. ¿Es evangélico eso, es mariano? Jesús dice, y su dulce Madre lo juzga también así: «Bienaventurados seréis cuando los hombres os odien, cuando os expulsen, os injurien y proscriban vuestro nombre como malo… Alegraos ese día y saltad de gozo… ¡Ay cuando todos los hombres hablen bien de vosotros!» 133. Y nosotros nos contristamos, nos perturbamos, cuando no se nos rodea de mil atenciones, cuanto parece que no se nos presta atención por un instante, cuando parece que se prefiere más a otras personas que a nosotros, cuando se habla un poco menos favorablemente de nosotros… Y estamos dichosos y alegres de ser puestos en primer lugar, de ver que nuestro trabajo es apreciado y alabado, de ocupar, a gran o a pequeña escala, un lugar de honor… ¿Es evangélico eso, es mariano? ★ No sería difícil proseguir y extender este examen de conciencia. Vivimos en un mundo al revés. Somos muy a menudo paganos con etiqueta cristiana. ¡Estamos tan lejos de la atmósfera cristiana y mariana en que debiéramos vivir!

He who commits a mortal sin separates himself totally from the principle of supernatural life which is God. He is cut off from his ultimate end, committing, as it were, suicide in the supernatural order. He who falls into venial sin impedes the action of God from exercising itself freely on him, and little by little ruins his supernatural health just as the alcoholic ruins the health of his body.

A God exists who created and orders the world and watches over human life on earth. God wants people to be good, nice, and fair to each other, as taught in the Bible and by most world religions. The central goal of life is to be happy and to feel good about oneself. God does not need to be particularly involved in one’s life except when he is needed to resolve a problem. Good people go to heaven when they die.

If you have a field covered with water because of poor drainage, he explained, crops either won’t grow there, or they will rot. If you don’t drain it, you will have a swamp and disease. But if you can dig a drainage channel, the field will become healthy and useful. What’s more, once the water becomes contained within the walls of the channel, it will flow with force and can accomplish things. “A Rule works that way, to channel your spiritual energy, your work, your activity, so that you’re able to accomplish something,” Father Cassian said.

“The structure of life in the monastery, the things you do every day, is not just pointless repetition,” said Brother Augustine Wilmeth, twenty-five, whose red Viking-like beard touches his chest. “It’s to train your heart and your spirit so that when you need it, when you don’t feel strong enough to will yourself to get through a difficult moment, you fall back on your training. You know that you wouldn’t be strong enough to do it if you hadn’t been kind of working at it and putting all the auxiliary things in place.”

Asceticism comes from the Greek word askesis, meaning “training.” The life prescribed by the Rule is thoroughly ascetic. Monks fast regularly, live simply, refuse comfort, and abide by the strict rules of the monastery. This is not a matter of earning spiritual merit. Rather, the monk knows the human heart and how its passions must be reined in through disciplined living. Asceticism is an antidote to the poison of self-centeredness common in our culture, which teaches us that satisfying our own desires is the key to the good life. The ascetic knows that true happiness can be found only by living in harmony with the will of God, and ascetical practices train body and soul to put God above self.

The overweight person diets not to punish him- or herself for being heavy but to become healthier. The athlete works out not because he feels guilty for sitting around watching TV but to train his body for competition. So it is with monks and their asceticism—and so it must be with us lay Christians. We practice self-denial to strengthen ourselves in the love and service of Christ and His people. “Suffering is part of the pursuit of Jesus Christ, who suffered first before His glory,” said Brother Ignatius. “To encounter God, you too need to suffer, and to be willing to experience suffering.”

A good example of what this better life could look like comes from the late mathematician and dissident Václav Benda. A faithful Catholic, Benda believed that Communism maintained its iron grip on the people by isolating them, fragmenting their natural social bonds. The Czech regime severely punished the Catholic Church, driving many believers to privatize their faith, retreating behind the walls of their homes so as not to attract attention from the authorities.

When we are truly ordered toward God, we won’t have to worry about immediate results—and that’s a good thing. In interviewing surviving dissidents from the Czech Communist era, researcher Taylor discovered something they had in common with Saint Benedict and his monks. They never expected to live to see the end of totalitarianism, and they did not really believe their activities would have any effect in the short term. But this worked to their advantage. “They surrendered themselves to the idea that these things were worth doing in and of themselves, not because they might have definite, measurable consequences,” Taylor says. “Havel, Benda, and the other dissidents made it clear that once you start down the path of consequentialism, you will always find a reason not to do anything. You have to want to do something because it’s worth doing, not because you think it will make the Communist Party fall in four years.”

Those engaged in building these structures should not be discouraged by failures in the short run. These are bound to happen. Rather, they must keep their balance and stay focused on, in Havel’s words, “the everyday, thankless, and never-ending struggle of human beings to live more freely, truthfully, and in quiet dignity.” Don’t be deceived by the ordinariness of this charge. This is politics at its most profound level. It is politics during wartime, and we are fighting nothing less than a culture war over what C. S. Lewis called “the abolition of man.” “The best resistance to totalitarianism is simply to drive it out of our own souls, our own circumstances, our own land, to drive it out of contemporary humankind,” said Václav Havel.

Many conservative Christians felt relief over the fate of the Supreme Court upon hearing the shocking (even to his supporters) news that Donald Trump had won the presidency. This is understandable, and we should urge the new administration to appoint justices strongly committed to religious liberty and protecting unborn life. But it can’t be repeated often enough: believers must avoid the usual trap of thinking that politics can solve cultural and religious problems. Trusting Republican politicians and the judges they appoint to do the work that only cultural change and religious conversion can do is a big reason Christians find ourselves so enfeebled. The deep cultural forces that have been separating the West from God for centuries will not be halted or reversed by a single election, or any election at all.

From now on, the cultic act proceeds by way of an offering of the totality of one’s life in love. The priesthood of Jesus Christ causes us to enter into a life that consists of becoming one with him and renouncing all that belongs only to us. For priests, this is the foundation of the necessity of celibacy but also of liturgical prayer, meditation on the Word of God, and the renunciation of material goods.

The fact that Jesus gives himself forever as food during the Last Supper signifies the anticipation of his death and Resurrection. This signifies the transformation of an act of human cruelty into an act of love and self-giving. So it is that Jesus accomplishes the fundamental renewal of worship that will forever remain valid and obligatory. He transforms the sin of men into an act of forgiveness and love into which his future disciples can enter by participating in what Jesus instituted. Thus we understand what Saint Augustine calls, in the Church, the transition from the Last Supper to the morning sacrifice. The Last Supper is the gift that God grants us in the love of Jesus who forgives. Humanity in turn can receive this gesture of love from God and return it to God.

The redemptive omnipotence of the act of Christ, who immolated Himself upon the Cross, derives from the fact that it is a perfect act of charity performed by a divine Person; the perfect act of the Incarnate Word. It is a supernatural act of charity towards God which makes Him forget all offenses. Such an act of charity performed by the Incarnate Word attains, by reason of the divine personality of the Word, an infinite efficacy to make satisfaction, to expiate, and to merit. The catechism teaches this doctrine to children. But do we ourselves comprehend it? Has it become for us a doctrine of life and everyday experience? It is easy to say that the act of charity of Christ attains, by reason of the divine personality, an infinite value and efficacy, but, do we seek to understand fully in our meditation and prayer this simple phrase that children know by memory yet whose profound meaning surpasses the understanding of angels?

Hence the saints at the level of knowledge and love made strenuous efforts to substitute the personality of God for their own, to die to themselves so that God might reign in them. They were armed with a holy hatred of their own ego. They sought to make God the principle of their actions, no longer acting according to the rules of the world or their own limited judgment, but according to God’s ideas and rules as received through faith. They sought to substitute the divine will for their own, and to act no longer for themselves but for God, loving Him not as themselves but infinitely more than themselves and more than any other thing whatsoever. They understood that God had to become for them another ego more intimate than their own. They had to realize that God was more “them” than they themselves because He is preeminently Being. Therefore, they made strong efforts to renounce their personality and every attitude of independence before God; they sought to make of themselves something divine. Consequently, they developed the most forceful personality conceivable. They obtained in some way what God possesses by nature, namely independence from every created thing, not only in the corporeal world but also in the world of intelligence.

Jesus took upon Himself the responsibility for all the sins of men, and He began to suffer for them as if it had been He who had committed them, as if He were impious, rebellious, frenzied, cowardly, ungrateful, and sacrilegious. He felt the divine anger and divine curse weigh on His soul while hell with supreme fury broke loose against Him. The horror of evil and all vices together seemed for an instant to suffocate Him. A cry burst from His lips on the Cross: “My God, My God, why have You deserted Me?” (Mt. 27:46). In this darkness, in this abandonment, Our Lord performed His greatest act of love. In the midst of this anguish He loved His Father above everything and He loved us even to the giving of His life for our salvation, only grieving that a greater number were not saved. This act of love makes abundant satisfaction for all hatreds. The obedience that it involves compensates for all rebellions in the eyes of God. The humiliations of the Passion redeem all acts of pride. The gentleness of Him crucified repairs all acts of anger and His sufferings pay for all sensuality.

In fact, the spiritualistic philosophers, outside Christianity, do not hesitate to affirm that they are indeed able to have feelings of ideal admiration, gratitude, and respect for God. Yet, according to them it is impossible to love with a love of friendship a being whom we have never seen, a being so superior that He is by Hs nature invisible and incomprehensible, a being to whom we owe all things but for whom we can do nothing. Friendship presupposes that the person who is loved is seen. Furthermore, it demands a certain equality, a certain common life, the reciprocal revealing of one’s most intimate thoughts and the possibility of one doing good for the other.

True love whereby another being is loved, not only for one’s own self-interest but for the other being itself, is not only a passive love but is also active. It is not a simple emotional satisfaction that is born at the sight of a pleasing object, but rather an effective and operating love whereby the good of the loved person is willed. This active love consists in going outside of self and one’s own egoism to be carried toward the being whose good is willed; in uniting oneself to this being by a communion of will and sentiment; and in dedicating oneself to the other being, in giving oneself to it in order to elevate it, make it better and more beautiful.

The Response of the Saints The response that the saints have given is this. They have done their utmost to love God with a love identical to His. God’s love is a love that is essentially active and effective, a love that acts and creates. The saints were not content with a simple emotional satisfaction, with a wonderful admiration, or with that superficial enthusiasm that is born from the idea of the divine perfections. They understood the saying of Jesus: “It is not those who say to me, ‘Lord, Lord’, who will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but the person who does the will of My Father in Heaven” (Mt. 7:21). They did not measure their charity on the basis of the sweetness of sensible devotion; instead, they loved God with a profound love of the will, which subsists even in the midst of desolations and aridity. This is a profound love which is nourished, as St. Catherine of Siena says, not only from the milk of spiritual consolations but also from the hard bread of tribulations. Here was love through which they desired first and foremost the glory of God and His Kingdom. The saints were consumed with a thirst for justice and the Kingdom of God.

I fear that the last one is addressed to us. Coldness! The warmth of charity is not a sensible warmth. It is a wholly spiritual fire which continues to flame in the midst of the desolations and aridity with which God purifies our sensibility. But this love must be operative. It is certain that all of us, like all Christians, must respond with love to God’s love because charity is a precept, not a counsel. Yet, is our love effective and operative or is it a self-satisfying, passive thing? Does it persist despite aridity and the desolations necessary to purify our sensibility? Are we disposed to go outside ourselves, to bend ourselves toward Our Lord, to humble ourselves as He humbled Himself? Are we dying to the sensible and natural life in order to live the life of Christ? Do we accept the daily sacrifice which the common life demands? Is our love like that of the saints?

The quality of our charity is not measured by the sweetness of a sensible devotion. The infallible signs of progress in charity are the hatred of sin and the configuration to Christ by means of progress in all the virtues and gifts of the Holy Spirit. If we do not wish to die to sin, if we do not wish to mortify ourselves, we do not love the Lord and we live the religious life in vain.

It is true that meditation on the Word of God is an important and fundamental task of the priest of God in the New Covenant. Even so, this Word was made flesh. To meditate on it always means also to be nourished by the flesh that is given to us in the Most Holy Eucharist as bread from heaven. To meditate on the Word in the Church of the New Covenant always amounts to abandoning oneself to the flesh of Jesus Christ. This abandonment implies accepting our own transformation by the Cross.

The woman who ignored the greengrocer’s slogan may well have hung a similar slogan just an hour before in the corridor of the office where she works. She did it more or less without thinking, just as our greengrocer did, and she could do so precisely because she was doing it against the background of the general panorama and with some awareness of it, that is, against the background of the panorama of which the greengrocer’s shop window forms a part. When the greengrocer visits her office, he will not notice her slogan either, just as she failed to notice his. Nevertheless their slogans are mutually dependent: both were displayed with some awareness of the general panorama and, we might say, under its diktat. Both, however, assist in the creation of that panorama, and therefore they assist in the creation of that diktat as well. The greengrocer and the office worker have both adapted to the conditions in which they live, but in doing so, they help to create those conditions. They do what is done, what is to be done, what must be done, but at the same time – by that very token – they confirm that it must be done in fact. They conform to a particular requirement and in so doing they themselves perpetuate that requirement. Metaphorically speaking, without the greengrocer’s slogan the office worker’s slogan could not exist, and vice versa. Each proposes to the other that something be repeated and each accepts the other’s proposal. Their mutual indifference to each other’s slogans is only an illusion: in reality, by exhibiting their slogans, each compels the other to accept the rules of the game and to confirm thereby the power that requires the slogans in the first place. Quite simply, each helps the other to be obedient. Both are objects in a system of control, but at the same time they are its subjects as well. They are both victims of the system and its instruments.

In everyone there is some longing for humanity’s rightful dignity, for moral integrity, for free expression of being and a sense of transcendence over the world of existences. Yet, at the same time, each person is capable, to a greater or lesser degree, of coming to terms with living within the lie. Each person somehow succumbs to a profane trivialization of his or her inherent humanity, and to utilitarianism. In everyone there is some willingness to merge with the anonymous crowd and to flow comfortably along with it down the river of pseudo-life.

First of all it is necessary to bear the defects of our neighbor. What afflicts the saints to a great degree are the offenses made to God, while what afflicts us more and makes us lose our patience are external defects, which often are a small thing in the eyes of God. We endure some sinners without any difficulty, while certain virtuous persons make us exercise an enormous patience.

the saints say and as St. Catherine of Siena continually repeated, the Christian must hate himself for love of divine justice. In other words, he must hate all in himself that is not from God and that injures the natural rights God has over his thought, his heart, his body, and his soul. He ought to be armed with a holy hatred for the remnants of sin that remain in him, and, as St. Paul says, crucify the flesh with its concupiscences.

These, then are the two principal motives for mortification: the consequences of sin and the elevation to a supernatural end. In other words, we must practice mortification out of hatred for sin and for the love of God, our ultimate end.

The story of Naboth (1 Kings 21:1-29), who absolutely refused to give his vineyard away to King Ahab, even though the latter said that he was willing to reimburse him completely, clearly shows the importance of this concrete share of the heritage. For Naboth, the vineyard was more than a valuable plot of land: it was his share in the promise that God made to Israel.

After sin, however, we must acknowledge not only our indigence, but also our misery: the misery of our wretched and egoistic heart, of our inconstant will, of our irregular, violent, and capricious character; the misery of our spirit, which commits unpardonable forgetfulness and falls into contradictions that it can and ought to avoid; and the misery of pride and concupiscence, which leads to indifference concerning the glory of God and the salvation of souls.

We can cease to be poor in two ways: by diverting these goods from their ultimate end, or by lacking trust in divine Providence. And these things we do to the extent that we make the goods of God serve our personal interests, outside any religious purpose. We also cease to be poor when we dissipate the goods of God, when we allow them to be damaged or lost, and when we waste time in dreaming or chatting—for our time belongs to God. The truly poor religious is hard working; and his work is that established by his rule, not anything else.

Bl. Angela of Foligno writes: “Every affection of the heart is dangerous, even that which we have for God, if it is not what it should be. Love is the center where all good is contained and the center where all evil is contained. Nothing on earth, neither creature nor dominion, is so terrible as love, because no power penetrates the soul, the mind, the heart as it does. If this force is not regulated, the soul rushes frivolously into all snares, and its love is its ruin. I am not speaking only of a love that is absolutely sinful, where the danger of going to hell escapes no one. I am also speaking of the love of God and neighbor when it is not what it ought to be. When the love of God is not accompanied by discernment and mortification of the heart, it leads to death and to illusion. Whoever loves God in order to be preserved from some accidental suffering or to taste some spiritual sweetness, does not love in the right order. He loves himself first, and then God” (chap. 64).

Charity is the supreme virtue which makes us love God for Himself alone, because He is infinitely good and because He loved us first (cf. 1 Jn. 4:10). This is the principal motive for which we love God. Yet, we also find many other secondary motives. For example, He gives us what we ask for, draws us to Himself, and makes the work undertaken for Him succeed.

Indeed, it is not only a question of an elevation of the intelligence, but of the elevation of the whole being toward God. It is a flight in which love contributes as much as intelligence.

“There are speculative souls,” says Massoulié (cf. Maynard), “curious about the things of God, who are not, however, souls of mental prayer. If in their considerations they experience a pleasure that surpasses all the pleasures of the senses, this pleasure often derives solely from knowledge and not from charity. They are moved more by the love of knowledge than by the love of God, whom they wish to penetrate. Therefore, this pleasure often increases their pride and only serves to make them more filled with themselves.”

It is not the consolation which we should seek and love, but God, who gives the consolation to those who truly love Him for Himself. It would be presumption to desire the more exalted degrees God reserves for the saints, who, like St. Dominic, are predestined to exercise a great influence on His Mystical Body. Like the publican of the Gospel (Lk. 18:13) and all the saints, we ought to stand in the last place, conform our will in all things to that of God, desire His Kingdom and think of Him. Then, it will be He who thinks of us and makes us grow continually to the degree to which He has decided to lead us.

Then, it will be He who thinks of us and makes us grow continually to the degree to which He has decided to lead us. It would be presumption to desire and to ask for visions and revelations rather than the living water, that is, the light of life and the intimate sense of the words of our divine Master. Visions and revelations are extraordinary favors which do not necessarily suppose the state of grace and are not at all needed for a superior development of charity. Like miracles, they have a utility that is rather external (that is, for one’s neighbor) and if they are not accompanied by a profound humility, they can also become dangerous, not in themselves, but incidentally. The danger arises inasmuch as they may make their recipients become complacent with themselves and may lead them to illusions (cf. Arintero). But to ask for the meaning of the divine is not a presumption. On the contrary, it is necessary to desire it with ardor. “Ask and it shall be given you, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you.”

St. Catherine de Ricci suffered this pain of the senses for a soul for whom she offered herself. A mysterious flame was lighted in her body. From her head to her feet were formed blisters filled with boiling water and when these were absorbed the body of the saint seemed parched with fire. She remained in her cell which became like an oven, painfully enduring the heat. This torment lasted forty days when it suddenly ended.

In her suffering, she brought us forth to the life of grace. It was accomplished in that painful moment when Our Lord said to the Holy Virgin: “Woman, behold your son,” committing her to St. John. Since the eighth century the Church has taught that St. John personified all the souls that were to be redeemed by the sacrifice of the Cross. Those words of Christ were certainly not directed to St. John alone. They denote in St. John all the souls that would be redeemed by the Cross. This is their spiritual sense. These words, as a sacramental word, produce what they signify: they produce in the soul of the Virgin a considerable increase of charity and of maternal charity toward us, while they produced in St. John’s soul a wholly filial affection, full of respect toward the Mother of God.

the priest must be on the watch. He must be on his guard in the face of the menacing powers of evil. He must keep the world awake for God. He must be the one who remains standing: upright before the trends of time. Upright in truth. Upright in the commitment for good. Standing before the Lord must always also include, at its depths, responsibility for humanity to the Lord, who in his turn takes on the burden of all of us to the Father. And it must be a taking on of him, of Christ, of his word, his truth, his love. The priest must be upright, fearless and prepared to sustain even insults for the Lord, as referred to in the Acts of the Apostles: they were “rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name” of Jesus (5:41).

“to serve” means closeness, it requires familiarity. This familiarity also involves a danger: when we continually encounter the sacred, it risks becoming habitual for us. In this way, reverential fear is extinguished. Conditioned by all our habits, we no longer perceive the great, new and surprising fact that he himself is present, speaks to us, gives himself to us. We must ceaselessly struggle against this becoming accustomed to the extraordinary reality, against the indifference of the heart, always recognizing our insufficiency anew and the grace that there is in the fact that he consigned himself into our hands. To serve means to draw near, but above all it also means obedience. The servant is under the word: “not my will, but thine, be done” (Lk

Nos contentamos con una mirada somera y superficial, lo bastante para establecer en el exterior una enmienda relativa; pero la purificación profunda del alma, la transformación progresiva de la vida humana en la vida divina, despojarnos del hombre viejo y revestirnos del nuevo, todo este trabajo de las profundidades del alma lo ignoramos casi por completo y dejamos que toda clase de miserias invadan esas profundidades. El buscarnos en todo a nosotros mismos, que es el resumen de todos los vicios del hombre y la causa de todas sus faltas, se acomoda muy bien con este sentimentalismo superficial. ¡Es tan agradable estar contento de sí mismo... y de Dios!... Y hallándonos a gusto en este Tabor, ¿por qué no hemos de hacer en él tres tiendas? [12].

Hay, en efecto, para mí en las criaturas, sembrados por la mano de su Autor, placeres infinitamente variados: placeres materiales de la vista, del oído, del olfato, del gusto, del tacto; las bellezas de la naturaleza y de las artes, los encantos de la música, los perfumes de las flores, el sabor de los alimentos, etc.: placeres morales de la familia, de la amistad, de la práctica de la virtud, etc.: placeres intelectuales de la literatura y de las ciencias, de la investigación y contemplación de la verdad: placeres sobrenaturales, en fin, en la oración, en las prácticas religiosas y en los toques divinos de la gracia. ¡Cuántos placeres, cuán variados y extensos! ¿Qué son estos placeres en la idea de Dios, que los ha criado, y qué papel desempeñan?

“Buscad, pues, ante todo el reino de Dios y su justicia, y todas las demás cosas os serán dadas por añadidura” [94]. El reino de Dios y la justicia de Dios, ¿qué es lo que esto significa? –Quiere decir la gloria divina y mi felicidad en ella. Éste es el fin, doble y uno, hacia el cual debe orientarse mi vida, al cual debo consagrarme. Estoy obligado a aspirar a él porque Nuestro Señor formalmente me manda que lo busque.

No he adquirido, pues, la virtud de la piedad sino cuando he llegado a adquirir esta facilidad y prontitud para conocer, amar y buscar a Dios en todas las cosas. ¡Dios mío!¡Cuán lejos estoy de esta prontitud!... Pobre hijo del hombre, ¿hasta cuándo tendré el corazón tan pesado? ¿Hasta cuándo amaré la vanidad y buscaré la mentira? [126]. ¿Cuándo se dilatará mi corazón para correr gozoso por las vías de la piedad? [127]. ¿Quién me dará alas como a la paloma para volar y descansar en Dios? [128].

¿En qué consiste, pues, el desorden? –En un retraso, una desviación, una parada de mi vida que, en todo o en parte, no se eleva hasta Dios. Cuando una parte de mi ser, o de mi movimiento, no alcanza, al menos indirectamente, esta unión sobrenatural que Dios quiere hacerme contraer con Él, para su gloria y para mi felicidad; cuando alguna cosa de mi ser no viene a parar en último término al fin total y verdadero, hay desorden: desorden más o menos pronunciado, según la naturaleza y la extensión del extravío. La excelencia del fin a que soy llamado no me permite jamás quedarme fuera y por debajo de él; y si lo hago así, causo una lesión a mi vida y hago una injuria a Aquel que es el autor, el director y el consumador de mi vida.

Lo que quito a Dios de las criaturas y lo que le quito de mi vida es para apropiármelo yo: de aquí es de donde nace el espíritu propio, el amor propio y el interés propio. Lo que de mi espíritu y sus conocimientos se detiene en mí, sin remontarse más alto, constituye el espíritu propio; lo que de mi voluntad y sus afectos se apega a mí, sin ir hasta Dios, constituye el amor propio; lo que de mis fuerzas y sus actos descansa en mí, sin pasar más allá, constituye el interés propio.

¿cuál es el origen de mis inquietudes, de mis perturbaciones, de mis agitaciones, de mis desalientos, de mis tristezas, cosas todas que son las señales de mi esclavitud? La fuente única de todo esto es que busco mi placer, estoy inquieto cuando temo verme privado de él, perturbado cuando lo he perdido, agitado cuando me cuesta trabajo obtenerlo, desalentado cuando no veo medio de volverlo a encontrar, triste cuando me falta del todo. Soy tanto más esclavo y tanto más desgraciado cuanto con más afán busco mi placer y con más ansia cifro en él mi felicidad humana. ¡Justo castigo del orden violado! “Porque”, dice San Agustín, “el que no da a Dios lo que le debe, haciendo lo que debe, se lo da sufriendo lo que debe. Y no hay medio entre estas dos cosas: en el instante mismo en que no hace lo que debe, sufre lo que debe, porque la belleza del orden universal no puede sufrir ni un solo instante ser manchada con la fealdad del pecado sin ser reparada por la belleza del castigo” [156]. 45.° El gemido universal.– Las criaturas, todas las criaturas no son esencialmente para mí otra cosa que instrumentos... –instrumentos dispuestos para la gloria de Dios: éste es su destino esencial.

Transgresión de un consejo.– Llamo transgresión simple de un consejo, aquella que no va acompañada de un pecado venial o mortal, porque es claro que también el pecado quebranta los consejos; pero puede acontecerme, y de hecho me acontece, que descuide un consejo sin cometer pecado, ya se haga esta transgresión por omisión o comisión, ya por un acto del espíritu, del corazón o de los sentidos, o bien por una causa interior habitual o exterior accidental. De esta manera se conservan tantos defectos y caprichos, inclinaciones y manías, modos de ver vulgarmente naturales y apreciaciones terrestres, curiosidades y futilidades, preferencias humanas y lazos molestos, acciones precipitadas, abandonos, etcétera; en una palabra, todo ese costear de una existencia habitualmente honesta, pero imperfecta, en la que lo humano domina con demasiada frecuencia y en la que lo divino no tiene por completo el lugar primero que debe tener en una vida cristiana.

La idea específica de la perfección no está en el sacrificio de mi satisfacción. Puesto que supongo que mi satisfacción es permitida y que no hay en ella ofensa de Dios, no está en contradicción con su gloria, no hay incompatibilidad alguna entre una y otra; basta que yo subordine la una a la obediencia de la otra y que las coloque en su orden esencial. Lo repito: la perfección no consiste en el sacrificio, sino en poner las cosas en su verdadero punto.

Frecuentemente esos sacrificios son lo contrario de lo que se debe hacer. Porque mientras yo abrazo esas privaciones no pienso en enderezar mis caminos, continúo buscándome a mí mismo y el desorden persiste en el mismo estado. Con frecuencia también escojo esos sacrificios bajo la inspiración de mi capricho, de mis gustos del momento; hasta en su elección me busco a mí mismo. El acto mismo por el cual los escojo es, a menudo, acaso un desorden. Como actos satisfactorios pueden tener cierto valor, pero para conducirnos a la perfección no tienen ninguno; por lo menos con mucha frecuencia.

Mis fracasos.– Por otra parte, esos sacrificios por mí elegidos tienen muchas veces el inconveniente de ser superiores a mis fuerzas y de no responder a las necesidades presentes de mi alma. Porque, en tanto que yo no haga la rectificación de mis intenciones, no estoy a la altura de esos sacrificios, no tengo las fuerzas suficientes para soportarlos. Por otra parte, la gracia, que proporciona su acción a los progresos de mi alma, no me es dada para eso, y entonces ¿qué sucede? –Que no produciendo esos ímpetus de generosidad los frutos que yo deseaba, no teniendo mi alma fuerzas para soportarlos, me desaliento, vuelvo a caer más bajo de lo que antes estaba, y el resultado más lastimoso de este triste ensayo es que creo imposible la perfección: me parece que he hecho todo lo que estaba en mi mano, que no he retrocedido ante el sacrificio, ¡y sólo he logrado descender!...

Porque juzgo las cosas desde el punto de vista de mi interés egoísta y de mi placer; y viéndolas así, así las aprecio y así obro en consecuencia. La acción y la voluntad están viciadas, sobre todo, porque lo está la inteligencia. Mis acciones dependen de mis afectos, mis afectos, de mis ideas; y desde el momento que mis ideas son falsas, mis afectos y mis acciones resultan falseados. “Verdaderamente”, dice el P. Surin, “nuestros defectos proceden casi todos de la perversidad de nuestros juicios y de que no referimos las cosas criadas a su principio, como deben hacerlo los hijos de Dios” [201]. “La vía de la justicia, he ahí nuestra vía”, dice San Agustín. “¿Cómo no caer en esta vía cuando se carece de luz? Por esto, en esa vía, la primera necesidad es ver, el gran negocio es ver” [202]. Si ver es la primera necesidad y el gran negocio, no ver es la gran desgracia, ver mal es el gran peligro. Mi mayor mal es, pues, no ver o ver mal.

Por eso la primera y la más urgente necesidad para mí es rectificar mis ideas sobre mí mismo, sobre las criaturas y sobre el uso que de ellas debo hacer. Mientras no rectifique esto nada se restablecerá en mí; mientras mis esfuerzos no tiendan directamente a eso serán estériles. La fe es la que purifica el corazón [205]. La fe es el conocimiento de la verdad, la verdad es la gloria de Dios vista en todo, y la verdad es el elemento primero y director de la piedad. Cuando yo haya logrado este conocimiento de la verdad, claro, habitual y dominante, mi corazón será pronto purificado y mi vida será piadosa.

Pues bien; es preciso llegar a formar en mí un hábito de esa intensidad para la gloria de Dios. Es necesario que el conocimiento, amor y servicio de Dios invadan todas mis potencias y las dominen tan completamente, que ya no necesite percibirlas de manera distinta. Es necesario que la piedad llegue a ser el movimiento primero de mi alma, en el mismo grado que lo es ahora el buscarme a mí mismo. Es necesario que el movimiento de la gracia ocupe el lugar, el oficio y el imperio poseídos ahora por el movimiento de la naturaleza; es necesario que lo divino obre en mí en las mismas condiciones en que ahora obra lo humano. Es necesario que se establezca en mi alma una orientación y como una imantación de la fina brújula del alma, que la haga dirigirse siempre hacia Dios y, por último, fijarse en Él. Entonces habré llegado a la perfección, e iré a Dios tan fácil, tan prontamente, iba a decir tan naturalmente, como voy ahora a mí mismo. ¿Cuándo sucederá esto?...

Real “reform” is to strive to let what is ours disappear as much as possible so [that] what belongs to Christ may become more visible. It is a truth well known to the saints. Saints, in fact, reformed the Church in depth, not by working up plans for new structures, but by reforming themselves. What the Church needs in order to respond to the needs of man in every age is holiness, not management.16

It is necessary to find concrete ways to stop being an obstacle to the divine action. But as long as our souls are lukewarm, all measures will be in vain. Routine is a terrible threat. It hardens us. It makes us blind. It makes us deaf to any questioning. It closes the doors and the shutters against the divine light. It prevents us from understanding the mistakes that we make. It prevents us from reacting, correcting ourselves, converting, and advancing. It fosters carelessness, degradation, corruption. Above all, it prevents us from going against the current. Nothing great can be accomplished with men of routine who have settled for mediocrity once and for all.

There is one problem that no structural reform will resolve: ignorance of God. Lukewarmness, the rejection of the evangelical requirements, the loss of the sense of sin, attachment to money have a common root in the loss of the sense of God. The degradation of the liturgy to a spectacle, negligence in liturgical celebrations and confessions, and spiritual worldliness are only symptoms. The structures or the institutions are not the things in crisis, but rather our faith and our fidelity to Jesus. The changes to be made are not only in the institutions, not even in morals, but first of all in the interior life of souls, in the depths of minds and hearts, in the convictions and the orientation of consciences. What must change radically is our relation to God.

Lay people sometimes claim a “ministry” at Mass so as to feel that they are taking part and actively involved. Let us reflect a bit on the nature of the active participation of Mary and of Saint John on Golgotha. They were there, silently allowing themselves to be penetrated, imbued, and shaped by the mystery of the Cross. Should I not, in turn, be concerned about knowing how I die with Jesus in each Eucharist and whether I agree to die to my sin? Is my Christian life built on prayer and on true intimacy with God? What place do prayer and the Word of God have in my life? In each of our Eucharistic celebrations, we ought to be able to say, like Saint Paul: “In Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day!” (1 Cor 15:31).

The applause for the Council came partly from those who had no intention whatsoever of becoming believers themselves, as Christian tradition understands it, but rather greeted the “progress” that the Church was making toward their own stance as a corroboration of their way. . . .

If God created us in his image and we are made for God, how can we not work and stand before God, constantly offering him our bodies, our hearts, all our abilities to love, and the purity of our priestly chastity? In his First Letter to the Corinthians, Saint Paul writes: [Brethren,] do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and that temple you are.    Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness,” and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.” So let no one boast of men. For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future, all are yours; and you are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s. (1 Cor 3:16-23)

Catherine Salles: Let your works be sometimes this, sometimes that, depending on the season, the hour, the day. Can one always speak? Always be silent? Always regain one’s strength? Always fast? Always give bread to the poor? Always clothe the naked? Always visit the sick? Always stop quarrels? Always bury the dead? Sometimes do this, sometimes that, calmly, serenely, and lovingly. But the principle that commands these actions neither starts nor must it end. May fraternal charity remain, as it is written.

El alma entra en la santidad. 2.° Los actos de la santidad.– ¿Qué es la santidad? –Un ejemplo me lo hará comprender fácilmente. El comerciante, que en un negocio lícito puede ganar doscientas pesetas, ¿se contentará con cien? –Evidentemente no. La condición fundamental de las negociaciones comerciales es que cada cual procure lealmente lo que conviene a sus intereses. Esto es lo que asegura la emulación, el progreso y el éxito. Yo estoy obligado a procurar la gloria de Dios; es el fin esencial de mi vida; las criaturas me han sido dadas para esto. Pero entre las criaturas hay unas que procuran la gloria de Dios más que otras. Si no quiero que mi conducta no sea más irracional que la del más inepto comerciante, debo escoger las criaturas que más procuran la gloria de Dios. Si no me cuido de elegir aquellas que me son más útiles para este fin, voy claramente contra la razón y contradigo con mi conducta el principio fundamental de mi existencia. Si quiero poner en este negocio –el único esencial– el cuidado y exactitud que los hombres ponen en sus negocios materiales, debo hacer distinción entre las criaturas y escoger aquellas que procuran más la gloria de Dios. Esta elección de lo más perfecto es el acto propio de la santidad.

Cuando todas las potencias, el espíritu, el corazón y los sentidos han adquirido esta facilidad; cuando en todas las cosas es pronta y fácilmente conocida, amada y abrazada la mayor gloria de Dios, entonces es cuando la santidad está establecida en el alma.

Hay aquí una gran ascensión del alma; vive ésta únicamente con la preocupación y la necesidad de glorificar a su Dios por los mejores medios posibles; el celo de su casa la devora [211]; no aspira mas que a honrarle y no vive sino para serle agradable; Dios es su todo; su gloria es toda su hambre y toda su sed [212]; su beneplácito es su único alimento [213]; no apetece nada del cielo ni quiere nada sobre la tierra, fuera de Dios y de su gloria; Él es el Dios de su corazón y toda su herencia por toda la eternidad [214]. Los deseos de su corazón y las múltiples necesidades de su cuerpo se resumen en esta sed única [215]. 5.

Si hay mayor gloria de Dios en el dolor, el santo acepta con gozo el dolor; si la hay mayor en la dicha, recibe la dicha con sencillez. Para Él una sola cosa establece diferencias entre las criaturas: la mayor gloria de Dios. Que esta mayor gloria se encuentre aquí o allá, poco le importa; dondequiera que la ve, allí se precipita sin cuidarse del goce o del dolor: se precipitaría en el infierno, si en el infierno pudiese dar mayor gloria a Dios.

No se trata, pues, de la destrucción de mi alma, ni de mi cuerpo, ni de mis facultades, ni de mis aptitudes, ni de mis aspiraciones, ni de mi actividad, ni de mis instrumentos, ni de mis placeres, ni de mis esperanzas, ni de mi felicidad: es más bien la depuración o purificación de todos esos elementos por medio de la destrucción de cierta viscosidad que me apega a las criaturas y de cierta independencia que me aleja de Dios; es el desasimiento de mi ser, rompiendo los lazos que lo tienen encadenado a las cosas de aquí abajo. Lo que es preciso romper, destruir y extirpar no soy yo, son esas ligaduras; en cuanto a mí, yo debo ser libertado. Y aplicando aquí las palabras de San Juan Bautista, si hay un “yo” que deba disminuirse y aniquilarse ante Dios, a fin de que Él crezca [217], este “yo” es el del egoísmo que se busca a sí propio, olvidando a Dios; este “yo” es el de la naturaleza que se mueve sin Dios.

“Nuestro Señor se apareció un día a la santa teniendo en su mano derecha una corona de oro y piedras preciosas, y en su mano izquierda una corona de espinas. “Ten presente, hija mía muy querida”, le dijo, “que has de llevarlas ambas en ocasiones y tiempos diversos. Escoge la que quieras. Si llevas en la vida terrena la corona de espinas, te reservaré la otra para la eterna. Si prefieres ahora la de oro y piedras preciosas, la de espinas quedará para después de tu muerte”. –“Hace mucho tiempo, Señor”, contestó la santa, “que no tengo voluntad propia; sólo quiero vuestro beneplácito: no me toca, pues, elegir. Sin embargo, ya que vuestra voluntad es que conteste, os diré que elijo en este mundo siempre de acuerdo con vuestra bienaventurada pasión y buscar siempre por vos mi alegría en el sufrimiento”. Entonces la santa, en un ímpetu de fervor, tomó la corona de espinas y la puso con sus dos manos en su cabeza, con tal violencia que las espinas se la horadaron toda alrededor” [225]. Escoger el sufrimiento y las tribulaciones, por un ardiente deseo de purificación absoluta, ya desde este mundo, y por no apartarse un punto de la imitación de Nuestro Señor, a fin de que antes de la muerte todo sea dejado y consumado.

To be able to hear it, it is necessary that we be recollected, detached from the world, and practice mortification of our heart, of our will, and of our judgment. If there is no silence in our soul and the voice of the world and the passions agitate it, we cannot hear the interior word of our Master. If we habitually take pleasure in our own way of seeing things and do not wish to receive counseling from anyone, we shall hear, above all else, ourselves, or else a perfidious and dangerous voice that seeks the way of our heart.

El alma desparramada, dividida en las mil preocupaciones de los sentidos, consume sus fuerzas en detalles y las pierde; pero en cambio, ¡cuánta fuerza cuando sus potencias están concentradas en la unidad, concentradas en Dios! “Buscad al Señor y permaneceréis firmes; buscad incesantemente su rostro” [247]. ”Buscad a Dios y vivirá vuestro espíritu” [248]. “He aquí lo que dice el Señor a la casa de Israel: Buscadme y viviréis” [249].

En primer lugar, tengo este primer poder que resulta de la reunión misma de las fuerzas de mi ser. ¿Quién será capaz de medir el poder de un hombre cuyas facultades están completamente unidas en un mismo esfuerzo? Cuando la inteligencia, la voluntad, las pasiones y las fuerzas del cuerpo están juntas, concentradas y como comprimidas sobre un mismo objeto, no hay poder en el mundo comparable a éste.

Si se ha podido decir con razón que lo que constituye la fuerza de los malos es la debilidad de los buenos, ¿cuál es la causa de esta debilidad? –La división, la falta de unidad. No solamente la división que separa los individuos, a los unos de los otros, y que impide toda unidad de miras, toda cohesión de voluntades y toda concentración de esfuerzos: esta división no es sino fruto de otra, más profunda y más lamentable, la división que existe en el fondo de cada alma.

Las tres luchas.– He examinado mi alma, ¿qué he encontrado en ella? –Mis gustos, mi capricho como regla práctica de mis ideas, de mis determinaciones y de mi conducta. Es así que mis conveniencias no son la regla seguida por Dios en la dirección del universo; luego, por este hecho, estoy separado de Dios en pensamiento, en voluntad y en acción. Primera lucha. Además, mis conveniencias no son la regla impuesta a mis semejantes y seguida por ellos. Cada uno tiene sus caprichos, sus gustos y sus conveniencias, y si cada uno se toma por regla a sí mismo, sobreviene la división universal de ideas, de resoluciones y de esfuerzos. Segunda lucha. En fin, mis conveniencias egoístas no son tampoco la regla trazada a mi vida. Mis gustos son inconstantes, los caprichos de un momento dado no son los del momento siguiente, las necesidades del cuerpo no son las del alma, los clamores de las pasiones se cruzan y se multiplican sin fin; de todo esto resulta la división en mi interior. Y por otra parte, estos caprichos me lanzan fuera de mí, en busca de las criaturas, con sus divergencias múltiples hasta el infinito. Y he aquí por dónde se divide el espíritu más todavía, los afectos se dividen también y luchan unos con otros, las acciones tienen la incoherencia de la precipitación y la agitación de la fiebre; el alma sale de sí misma por todos sus poros; es como un fuelle agujereado por todas partes, como un pozo desmoronado cuya agua se escapa por las grietas de las piedras, como una máquina dislocada cuyas piezas están desunidas: división, lucha conmigo mismo.

Los afectos de mi alma siendo transferidos a Dios, mi único necesario, no se ven ya importunados por la división de la criatura; las agitaciones de aquí abajo no pueden ya alcanzar a mi alma que se ha desembarazado de ellas, y vive en región más encumbrada. Pueden producirse abajo, en esa región de los sentidos y de la sensibilidad que confinan con el mundo inferior, pero no suben jamás a la parte superior del alma, que vive en Dios y mora en las regiones de la paz. Mi alma conserva su igualdad de temple y de acción a través de las cosas todas, agradables o desagradables. Ahora que todo le trae este crecimiento de vida, que es su única ambición, ahora que por la piedad sabe utilizar todas las cosas con la mira puesta en el fin único, las vicisitudes humanas no imprimen ya al alma esos vaivenes semejantes a los que sufre el cuerpo en el mar revuelto de las muchedumbres. 34.

The ‘accursed’ are less than their fellow humans. This is why it is important to always be aware of language and policy which ‘others’ and dehumanises. The media and social media have reverberated with language like ‘covidiots’, ‘selfish morons’ and ‘granny killers’. I can personally attest that peaceful protestors were wrongly characterised as ‘violent anti-lockdowners’. A study20 claimed that non-mask wearers were more likely to be psychopaths.

Normative pressure is enhanced and sustained when we wear masks in public. They are a visible indicator that there is danger present all around, in the air we breathe and in the people we meet. Masked faces prime you to think of danger. We become walking billboards for disease and danger. They keep fear in our faces. Literally. They also distinguish the compliant from the rebels, although of course there are many valid reasons, and non-exhaustive legal exemptions, for not wearing a mask.

The reason for wearing masks became inverted. When I spoke to Robert Dingwall (a Professor of Sociology who advises the government) he told me he was convinced that masks had been introduced partly because they are ‘a symbolic reminder that people are dangerous, the world is dangerous, and you might feel safer at home.

New strains provide a psychological justification for actions the government may wish to take anyway. Worryingly, the virus will always mutate and produce new variants, which can justify action before the new variants are fully understood. A government could keep new variant bait and switch policies going for as long as there are viruses. That’s forever, by the way.

There is a discernible blend of scapegoating and censorship among the self-appointed keepers-of-truth during the Covid epidemic. These days, no one is to be burnt at the stake or ritually sacrificed, just metaphorically cast into a desert, professionally shamed, no-platformed, unpublished, removed from the modern-day public fora of Twitter and YouTube. Silenced and banished. In this way the scapegoat can take on the sins of society, as well as serve as a warning to other potential dissenters. Speak up, and you are next. The media, Big Tech social media giants, politicians, scientists and perhaps all of us, the ‘mob’, have enforced a climate of fear through scapegoating.

I came across Professor Townsend on Twitter. Sadly, during the epidemic she decided to withdraw from the platform. ‘I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with Twitter but during the dark days of 2020–21, I witnessed reprehensible behaviour by some academics,’ she told me. ‘People who I previously admired have behaved in dreadful ways and said absolutely vicious things about other academics that were completely unwarranted. Science, or at least scientific debate, has died in these times. I decided to leave the toxicity of Twitter and focus my energies on other ways of communicating that permit dialogue and nuance.’

The Sacred Scriptures use the image of the vine in various ways. In a particular case, the vine serves to express the Mystery of the People of God. From this perspective which emphasizes the Church's internal nature, the lay faithful are seen not simply as labourers who work in the vineyard, but as themselves being a part of the vineyard. Jesus says, "I am the vine, you are the branches" (Jn 15:5).

It is no exaggeration to say that the entire existence of the lay faithful has as its purpose to lead a person to a knowledge of the radical newness of the Christian life that comes from Baptism, the sacrament of faith, so that this knowledge can help that person live the responsibilities which arise from that vocation received from God. In arriving at a basic description of the lay faithful we now more explicitly and directly consider among others the following three fundamental aspects: Baptism regenerates us in the life ot the Son of God; unites us to Christ and to his Body, the Church; and anoints us in the Holy Spirit, making us spiritual temples.

It is possible to say that this call to holiness is precisely the basic charge entrusted to all the sons and daughters of the Church by a Council which intended to bring a renewal of Christian life based on the gospel[41]. This charge is not a simple moral exhortation, but an undeniable requirement arising from the mystery of the Church: she is the choice vine, whose branches live and grow with the same holy and life-giving energies that come from Christ; she is the Mystical Body, whose members share in the same life of holiness of the Head who is Christ; she is the Beloved Spouse of the Lord Jesus, who delivered himself up for her sanctification (cf. Eph 5:25 ff.). The Spirit that sanctified the human nature of Jesus in Mary's virginal womb (cf. Lk 1:35) is the same Spirit that is abiding and working in the Church to communicate to her the holiness of the Son of God made man.

The vocation to holiness must be recognized and lived by the lay faithful, first of all as an undeniable and demanding obligation and as a shining example of the infinite love of the Father that has regenerated them in his own life of holiness.

Holiness, then, must be called a fundamental presupposition and an irreplaceable condition for everyone in fulfilling the mission of salvation within the Church. The Church's holiness is the hidden source and the infallible measure of the works of the apostolate and of the missionary effort. Only in the measure that the Church, Christ's Spouse, is loved by him and she, in turn, loves him, does she become a mother fruitful in the Spirit.

Holiness, then, must be called a fundamental presupposition and an irreplaceable condition for everyone in fulfilling the mission of salvation within the Church. The Church's holiness is the hidden source and the infallible measure of the works of the apostolate and of the missionary effort. Only in the measure that the Church, Christ's Spouse, is loved by him and she, in turn, loves him, does she become a mother fruitful in the Spirit. Again we take up the image from the gospel: the fruitfulness and the growth of the branches depends on their remaining united to the vine.

"As sharers in the mission of Christ, priest, prophet and king, the lay faithful have an active part to play in the life and activity of the Church... Strengthened by their active participation in the liturgical life of their community, they are eager to do their share in apostolic works of that community. They lead to the Church people who are perhaps far removed from it; they earnestly cooperate in presenting the Word of God, especially by means of catechetical instruction; and offer their special skills to make the care of souls and the administration of the temporal goods of the Church more efficient"[122]

Through evangelization the Church is built up into a community of faith: more precisely, into a community that confesses the faith in full adherence to the Word of God which is celebrated in the Sacraments, and lived in charity, the principle of Christian moral existence. In fact, the "good news" is directed to stirring a person to a conversion of heart and life and a clinging to Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour; to disposing a person to receive Baptism and the Eucharist and to strengthen a person in the prospect and realization of new life according to the Spirit.

Simply in being Christians, even before actually doing the works of a Christian, all are branches of the one fruitful vine which is Christ. All are living members of the one Body of the Lord built up through the power of the Spirit. The significance of "being" a Christian does not come about simply from the life of grace and holiness which is the primary and more productive source of the apostolic and missionary fruitfulness of Holy Mother Church. Its meaning also arises from the state of life that characterizes the clergy, men and women religious, members of secular institutes and the lay faithful.

What has been said about the spiritual vocation can also be said-and to a certain degree with greater reason-of the infinite number of ways through which all members of the Church are employed as labourers in the vineyard of the Lord, building up the Mystical Body of Christ. Indeed as a person with a truly unique lifestory, each is called by name, to make a special contribution to the coming of the Kingdom of God. No talent, no matter how small, is to be hidden or left unused (cf. Mt 25:24-27). In this regard the apostle Peter gives us a stern warning: "As each has received a gift, employ it for one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace" (1 Pt 4:10).

To Discover and Live One's Vocation and Mission 58. The fundamental objective of the formation of the lay faithful is an ever-clearer discovery of one's vocation and the ever-greater willingness to live it so as to fulfil one's mission. God calls me and sends me forth as a labourer in his vineyard. He calls me and sends me forth to work for the coming of his Kingdom in history. This personal vocation and mission defines the dignity and the responsibility of each member of the lay faithful and makes up the focal point of the whole work of formation, whose purpose is the joyous and grateful recognition of this dignity and the faithful and generous living-out of this responsibility.

To be able to discover the actual will of the Lord in our lives always involves the following: a receptive listening to the Word of God and the Church, fervent and constant prayer, recourse to a wise and loving spiritual guide, and a faithful discernment of the gifts and talents given by God, as well as the diverse social and historic situations in which one lives.

It is not a question of simply knowing what God wants from each of us in the various situations of life. The individual must do what God wants, as we are reminded in the words that Mary, the Mother of Jesus, addressed to the servants at Cana: "Do whatever he tells you" (Jn 2:5). However, to act in fidelity to God's will requires a capability for acting and the developing of that capability. We can rest assured that this is possible through the free and responsible collaboration of each of us with the grace of the Lord which is never lacking. Saint Leo the Great says: "The one who confers the dignity will give the strength!"[210]

This, then, is the marvelous yet demanding task awaiting all the lay faithful and all Christians at every moment: to grow always in the knowledge of the richness of Baptism and faith as well as to live it more fully. In referring to birth and growth as two stages in the Christian life the apostle Peter makes the following exhortation: "Like newborn babes, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up to salvation" (1 Pt 2:2).

Neither son knew his father. The prodigal son thought he had lost his father’s love because he did not earn it through obeying him; rather, he had only offended his father, not lost his love. The older son had worked hard for his father, thinking his work would earn his father’s love. The father’s response to each of them shows his love is far wider than their expectations. Likewise, Jesus has won the grace for each of us to go to the Father in prayer, precisely when we least believe we are freely loved, to see how the Father sees us, to hear how He speaks to us, and to experience how He loves us in that moment. Jesus suffers when we fear to approach the Father, who is longing to embrace us. He deeply desires to see us receive the love that restores us to our dignity. He would rather risk being rejected by us than cheapen His love, downgrading it to something we could earn. He wants so much more for us. The experience of the gift of His love cannot be reduced.

Yet, how often we project onto God our perceptions of what others have shown us. When others are disappointed with us, we can equate it with thinking that God is disappointed too. Or, if I don’t like myself, how can God like me? We so often think that He’ll only love us when we get over that bad habit, make more time for family, let go of that grudge, etc. Yet this is nowhere in the Gospel. When I catch myself thinking this way, I have to pause and ask myself: How did I become the judge of what God loves? How could I determine the threshold of what moves His heart?

A young woman who entered Carmel at age fifteen also had her own battle to fight against self-reliance: St. Therese. Her one goal was to become a saint, but she quickly found that she was completely incapable of achieving it on her own. There were so many virtues to acquire and sacrifices to be made. She felt she was too weak. However, everything she knew of God was rooted in the truth that He would not inspire a desire that was impossible. Therefore sanctity was not about what she could do for God, or about stacking up her own salvation points, but rather boldly believing in His love, trusting He would supply what she lacked.

The challenge is to identify when fear is being used deceptively or to manipulate, or is not well-calibrated to the actual threat and overwhelms us. If we are nudged towards a ‘greater good’ we play no active role in deciding what ‘good’ is. We have handed over the big decisions. We are like children being guided by adults who know best. If rule is by ‘science’ and we, the ignorant population, don’t get to review the software code of the models behind our new commandments, it is akin to the peasantry enduring sermons in Latin before the first English translations of the Bible. The obvious argument in favour of fear is that the use of fear is acceptable if it works, if it kept us safe and if there is a net benefit for society.

If we want to recover, if we want life to go back to normal, we need to dial down the cortisol. One of the simplest measures the government could take would be to remove the mask mandate. They are not backed up by convincing scientific evidence or medical necessity (at least, the government hasn’t shown us this evidence) and they are primarily a behavioural psychology tool which is a perfect example of unintended consequences. Masks are a visual metaphor signalling danger, perpetuating the fear and disrupting the human connection and communication which will be vital to society’s recovery.

Governments understand that fear is an unarguable fact of human psychology. History shows us that they will leverage fear, supposedly in our interests, ‘for our own good’, at the same time as advancing other interests which might not suit us so well. A government that nudges does not trust the people. A government that nudges has given up on debate and transparency and opted for covert manipulation – that is something to be wary of, if not frightened.

During the Covid epidemic, the UK government threatened us with longer lockdowns or tougher restrictions if we misbehaved, and rewards such as the return of the ‘rule of six’ or garden meetings were dangled in front of us if all went well. The relationship between government and citizen was reminiscent of a strict parent and child relationship, with alternating use of the naughty step and then offering sweets for good behaviour. Citizens were not treated like adults. We were told frightening ‘bedtime stories’ every day via the news and Downing Street briefings to ensure compliance with a set of ever-changing and sometimes bizarre rules. There is something intrinsically infantilising about nudge. The behavioural scientists sometimes let the paternalism show through the chinks with their references to locking up the biscuit tin, or comparing us to children who don’t need to be asked if we want to learn to read, as though whatever they plan for us is exactly the same as reading.

The vaccine programme appears to be the Happy Ending to the Horrible Story of the Covid-19 pandemic. But I am cautious. Not because I am ‘anti-vax’, but because I have observed that this stage of the story is also being written in the language of emotional manipulation and coercive control. Some of the vaccine messaging is optimistic, proud and forward-looking. Some is straight from the behavioural science handbook. The message ‘Impfen = Freiheit’ which translates as ‘Vaccination = Freedom’ was projected on a TV tower in Düsseldorf, Germany. Proud optimism or blatant propaganda? The term ‘vaccine hesitancy’ is now used to describe the attitude of people who have decided not to get vaccinated. It implies a slight pathologisation, that those reluctant to have a vaccine may have some sort of mental condition, rather than be making an individual choice based on risk analysis and rational preferences. It is designed to denigrate the vaccine sceptic, to make them look a bit silly. It also implies the ‘hesitation’ is just a step towards the inevitable, part of the process – come on dear, we’ll get you over that hump and you’ll have your vaccination in the end. Surely an ad hominem attack is less ethical and robustly persuasive than evidence would be?

I’m really worried. My wife and I just don’t have the same feelings for each other we used to have. I guess I just don’t love her anymore and she doesn’t love me. What can I do?” “The feeling isn’t there anymore?” I asked. “That’s right,” he reaffirmed. “And we have three children we’re really concerned about. What do you suggest?” “Love her,” I replied. “I told you, the feeling just isn’t there anymore.” “Love her.” “You don’t understand. The feeling of love just isn’t there.” “Then love her. If the feeling isn’t there, that’s a good reason to love her.” “But how do you love when you don’t love?” “My friend, love is a verb. Love—the feeling—is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?”

Proactive people make love a verb. Love is something you do: the sacrifices you make, the giving of self, like a mother bringing a newborn into the world. If you want to study love, study those who sacrifice for others, even for people who offend or do not love in return. If you are a parent, look at the love you have for the children you sacrificed for. Love is a value that is actualized through loving actions. Proactive people subordinate feelings to values. Love, the feeling, can be recaptured.

Frankl says we detect rather than invent our missions in life. I like that choice of words. I think each of us has an internal monitor or sense, a conscience, that gives us an awareness of our own uniqueness and the singular contributions that we can make. In Frankl’s words, “Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life…. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone’s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.”

Childlike dependency means being flexible when circumstances change in my day, because I know God is in charge. It means genuine delight in the smallest joys because I know they are a gift from Him and are not owed to me. It means a freedom from fear, which allows me to face my limits with every expectation of the Father’s blessing.

So much in our modern mindset follows the axiom “How can I get the most for putting in the least?” And it trickles down into so many of our thoughts. How can I enjoy the most amount of flavor with the least amount of weight gain? How can I have the best prayer life with the least amount of effort? How can I get to heaven with the least amount of commitment? And how can I be happily in love with the least amount of sacrifice?

Empathic listening is also risky. It takes a great deal of security to go into a deep listening experience because you open yourself up to be influenced. You become vulnerable. It’s a paradox, in a sense, because in order to have influence, you have to be influenced. That means you have to really understand.

“Me parece que el alma que está en esta indiferencia y que nada quiere, sino que deja querer a Dios lo que a Él agrade, tiene su voluntad en una expectación sencilla y general; tanto más cuanto que esperar no es hacer ni obrar, sino permanecer expuesto a algún acontecimiento. Y si os fijáis, la expectación del alma es verdaderamente voluntaria, aunque no es una acción, sino una simple disposición a recibir lo que sobreviniere, y cuando los sucesos llegan, la expectación se convierte en consentimiento o aquiescencia; pero antes de que sobrevengan el alma está en espera, indiferente a todo lo que a la voluntad divina le plazca ordenar”

No es común, cuando Dios me envía un consuelo, ver ante todo la mano de Dios que me lo regala, amarlo sobre todo como operación divina, y no detenerse sino en el fruto espiritual que Dios quiere producir en mí por medio del consuelo: mi primer movimiento es detenerme en el mismo consuelo, complacerme en él y no amar más que el gozo que por él experimento. Estoy agradecido a Dios por el placer que me envía, al cual soy sensible, del cual disfruto y en el que descanso; y no pienso en darle gracias por su acción ni sobre todo por el fruto espiritual que quiere producir en mí, que es mi aprovechamiento y progreso hacia Él, y así el consuelo se convierte para mí en fin, cesa de ser medio.

Me importa mucho en la práctica saber cómo mi acción debe unirse a la de Dios. Si no sé esto corro el riesgo de estorbar la acción de Dios y de sustituir la suya con la mía, o, no prestando la mía en la medida que Él quiere, vengo a poner trabas a la suya. Si mi acción no va acorde con la de Dios, el trabajo de la piedad sufre necesariamente, porque cuando dos acciones concurren a un mismo fin, el efecto útil que producen está en proporción del concierto que hay entre ambas.

Each of us tends to think we see things as they are, that we are objective. But this is not the case. We see the world, not as it is, but as we are—or, as we are conditioned to see it. When we open our mouths to describe what we see, we in effect describe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms. When other people disagree with us, we immediately think something is wrong with them. But, as the demonstration shows, sincere, clearheaded people see things differently, each looking through the unique lens of experience.

One way to quickly grasp the self-evident nature of principles is to simply consider the absurdity of attempting to live an effective life based on their opposites. I doubt that anyone would seriously consider unfairness, deceit, baseness, uselessness, mediocrity, or degeneration to be a solid foundation for lasting happiness and success. Although people may argue about how these principles are defined or manifested or achieved, there seems to be an innate consciousness and awareness that they exist.

borrowing strength builds weakness. It builds weakness in the borrower because it reinforces dependence on external factors to get things done. It builds weakness in the person forced to acquiesce, stunting the development of independent reasoning, growth, and internal discipline. And finally, it builds weakness in the relationship.

Habits, too, have tremendous gravity pull—more than most people realize or would admit. Breaking deeply imbedded habitual tendencies such as procrastination, impatience, criticalness, or selfishness that violate basic principles of human effectiveness involves more than a little willpower and a few minor changes in our lives. “Lift off” takes a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom takes on a whole new dimension.

When two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden eggs, the benefits, than they are in preserving the relationship that makes them possible, they often become insensitive and inconsiderate, neglecting the little kindnesses and courtesies so important to a deep relationship. They begin to use control levers to manipulate each other, to focus on their own needs, to justify their own position and look for evidence to show the wrongness of the other person.

When children are little, they are very dependent, very vulnerable. It becomes so easy to neglect the PC work—the training, the communicating, the relating, the listening. It’s easy to take advantage, to manipulate, to get what you want the way you want it—right now! You’re bigger, you’re smarter, and you’re right! So why not just tell them what to do? If necessary, yell at them, intimidate them, insist on your way. Or you can indulge them. You can go for the golden egg of popularity, of pleasing them, giving them their way all the time. Then they grow up without any internal sense of standards or expectations, without a personal commitment to being disciplined or responsible.

lack of security in myself is not a mistake nor a reason for shame. When paired with a bold confidence in the Lord, it is a sign of spiritual health. It helps me to put my security in someone greater—the Lord. If we believe that we have what it takes, we box God out of the picture. So we shouldn’t be surprised if, in His mercy, God may allow us to fall on occasion so that we can come to rely on Him more fully.

Childlike dependency means being flexible when circumstances change in my day, because I know God is in charge. It means genuine delight in the smallest joys because I know they are a gift from Him and are not owed to me. It means a freedom from fear, which allows me to face my limits with every expectation of the Father’s blessing. I have one word taped to the inside of the laptop I use: ASK. It’s not intended

God knows that by inviting us into living a selfless love, we can begin to live His will, which is most true to our dignity while creating a deep intimacy with Him.

Psychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you. Your upbringing, your childhood experience essentially laid out your personal tendencies and your character structure. That’s why you’re afraid to be in front of a group. It’s the way your parents brought you up. You feel terribly guilty if you make a mistake because you “remember” deep inside the emotional scripting when you were very vulnerable and tender and dependent. You “remember” the emotional punishment, the rejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn’t perform as well as expected.

It means that as human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to values. We have the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Look at the word responsibility—“response-ability”—the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling.

Most of us are masters at running ahead to think of the worst-case scenario. Yet we cannot know what the future holds, and the grace to live it will only be given in the moment. The temptation to focus on ourselves will lead us down the wrong path; it makes us lose sight of God. Without seeking to follow Him, I forge onward—stressed and alone—convinced no one is looking out for me.

How do we live with trust regarding the future? Trust is looking at the days and years ahead as the unraveling of the gift of my life for Jesus. And at the end of my life, I will have given it all back to Him. Of course, Jesus is not asking us to die without a house, a closet of clothes, friends and family, or a bank account. But whatever we are given is meant to be given back to Him so that it does not take us away from loving Him. He is first in our lives. And in the promise of heaven, we receive an exponential, overflowing bounty from our gift to Him: the fullness of His life.

pienso que un cierto debilitamiento del lugar del hombre y de las virtudes masculinas en nuestro mundo a favor de valores más femeninos (de protección, de ternura, de compasión…) no deja de inducir el riesgo de una educación muy «maternal», donde se trata demasiado de evitar todo dolor, todo sufrimiento, toda lucha, donde se tiende a incubar y sobreproteger a los hijos. Eso acaba por volverlos frágiles e inseguros, incapaces de aceptar el sufrimiento y la frustración, cosa sin embargo indispensable para devenir adultos. Sin contar con el hecho de que la desaparición del padre debilita el rol de la mujer.

La necesidad de atención y de escucha es una necesidad muy profunda para muchos. La paternidad es ante todo una presencia. Una presencia que no tiene por qué ser permanente (¡el hijo necesita respirar de vez en cuando!), sino una presencia de calidad en los momentos de encuentro, y una presencia con la que se puede contar en caso de necesidad. El padre no tiene que estar ahí permanentemente, pero cuando está ofrece una verdadera escucha y atención, y el hijo sabe que, si lo necesita, puede contar con él.

Una deformación frecuente de la paternidad es la del sacerdote que, más que un padre, es un hombre de negocios. Dicho de otro modo, lo que cuenta más para él son las obras que realizar: la construcción de la nueva sala parroquial, la decoración de la iglesia, o la puesta en marcha del plan pastoral que ha preparado para la parroquia… Estas obras son legítimas y necesarias, pero se corre el peligro de darles la prioridad. Eso quiere decir que se evalúa a las personas según su utilidad para tal o cual obra: a la persona eficaz, competente, que puede ayudarme a realizar este proyecto, le voy a prestar mucha atención, mientras que quien está poco dotado y no tiene ninguna utilidad para mis planes se sentirá puesto al margen. En lugar de reconocer en cada persona, incluso en la más pobre, alguien que merece toda mi atención porque el Señor la ama con un amor único, la juzgo con criterios exteriores de rentabilidad y de eficacia.

En general es bastante natural para una mujer ser madre. Ser padre por el contrario es más difícil, eso es del orden de una decisión. No contentarme con haber hecho un hijo a una mujer (cosa que no cuesta un gran esfuerzo), sino reconocer a este niño como mi hijo o mi hija, asumir mi responsabilidad de padre. Eso supone una decisión, un reconocimiento, un compromiso de mi voluntad. El pequeño me plantea una cuestión a la que estoy llamado a responder: ¿Qué vas a hacer conmigo? ¿Te vas a ocupar de mis necesidades, acogerme y amarme, proveer a mi comida, darme un techo, protegerme? Y otra cuestión aún más radical: ¿qué educación vas a darme? ¿Qué valores vas a transmitirme?

Cualesquiera sean las fragilidades e imperfecciones personales, sean las que fueren las dificultades exteriores que pueda encontrar en su ministerio, el sacerdote debe siempre ser un hombre de fe.

El espíritu de fe, esa es a fin de cuentas la principal cualidad del ministro de Cristo.

Nuestro peor pecado, no consiste en nuestras miserias y fragilidades humanas (Dios sabe muy bien aprovecharlas), sino en nuestra falta de fe en la fidelidad y el poder de Dios.

Necesitamos consentir en depender completamente de la gracia de Dios. Ese es el camino para recibirla con más abundancia. Nada atrae tanto la gracia del Espíritu Santo como la humildad: «Dios resiste a los soberbios, y a los humildes da la gracia», dice san Pedro[18]. No atribuirnos a nosotros mismos el bien que hacemos, no usarlo para inflar nuestro «ego», o reivindicar algo, sino restituir ese bien a Dios, que es la única fuente, en la acción de la gracia.

Estoy convencido de que los fieles tienen hoy más necesidad de consuelo, de recibir ánimo, que de correcciones y reproches. Estos últimos pueden ser a veces necesarios, pero deben darse con sentido común (no exigir a nadie más de lo que Dios le pide) y con mansedumbre y paz. La experiencia muestra bien que el mayor peligro que acecha a las almas es el desaliento. Nuestro ministerio es una misión alentadora.

En el ejercicio de su ministerio, el sacerdote debe estar atento para evitar toda forma de dureza, de intransigencia, de arrogancia, y mostrarse verdaderamente como un hombre manso y humilde a imagen de Cristo y de tantos santos pastores que ha conocido la Iglesia en su historia. No puede ser un hombre que se deje llevar por la ira. Este sentimiento es inevitable, a veces incluso legítimo, pero recordemos lo que dice san Pablo: «No se ponga el sol estando todavía airados, y no deis ocasión al diablo»[33]. A veces se tiene derecho a enfadarse, ¡pero nunca más de un día!

La paternidad supone a la vez una proximidad y una distancia. Proximidad de la presencia, de la ternura, del cuidado del otro. Pero al mismo tiempo una distancia: la del respeto, de la no invasión del dominio propio e íntimo del otro. Esta distancia supone a veces aceptar una cierta soledad; no puedo exigir del otro que colme todas mis necesidades, que responda a mis expectativas. Debo adquirir esa madurez que me haga encontrar en Dios lo que puede satisfacer mis necesidades más fundamentales: necesidad de paz, de seguridad, de plenitud, de felicidad.

bienaventurado el que es capaz de acoger y mantener en él la Paz de Dios, para luego transmitirla a los demás. No difundir en torno a él el miedo, la inquietud, la división, la agitación, la amargura, sino irradiar la grande y mansa paz divina. Que toda su vida y su predicación pudiese transmitir el don de Cristo Resucitado a sus discípulos: «¡La paz sea con vosotros!».

Hay que vigilar sobre esa necesidad que tenemos a veces de desahogarnos sobre nuestras dificultades, o de justificarnos. Estamos en un mundo que habla demasiado, que está en la ilusión de creer que, cuanto más se hable de los problemas, mejor se los resuelve. Hay por cierto cuestiones de las que hay que debatir para encontrar buenas respuestas. Pero a menudo, hablando demasiado de las dificultades, se las hace más pesadas. Las situaciones difíciles requieren también silencio, maduración interior y oración para afrontarlas de manera justa. Hay que saber tomarse el tiempo de recuperar la paz antes de expresarse, para no hacerlo bajo la presión de las emociones.

No deben exigir agradecimiento o gratitud particular por lo que hacen por sus hijos. Es algo bueno cuando lo reciben, pero no pueden exigirlo, y la mayor parte del tiempo esta gratitud no será proporcional a lo que ellos han dado y sufrido. Deben aceptar que su amor sea con frecuencia incomprendido, a veces incluso rechazado o despreciado. Es eso lo que vive el Padre del cielo en relación con sus propios hijos. El siervo no es mayor que su amo, el padre terrestre, incluido el padre espiritual, debe también esperar eso y aceptarlo. Tu consuelo no vendrá siempre de tus hijos, sino que te llegará de Dios, de quien te sentirás cercano, pues él sufre y ama contigo y como tú.

PARA AMPLIAR LA CUESTIÓN, añadiría que el sacerdote debe cuidar de que los laicos puedan desarrollar plenamente su papel esencial en la vida y la misión de la Iglesia. Estar al servicio de las familias, permitir a cada laico cualquiera sea su estado de vida encontrar su sitio, su parte de responsabilidad, su contribución a la evangelización o a otras misiones de la Iglesia. La promoción del lugar de los laicos (sobre todo hoy) en la vida de la Iglesia y especialmente el anuncio del Evangelio es algo que los sacerdotes deben tener en el corazón. Hay muchos ambientes a los que los sacerdotes no tienen acceso, y en los que están presentes los laicos. Algunas responsabilidades asumidas por los sacerdotes podrían ser más compartidas por laicos, para dar más disponibilidad a los sacerdotes en lo que es más esencial en su misión: la oración, la celebración de los sacramentos, el anuncio del Evangelio.

La oración por el pueblo es un deber exigente, pero es también una gracia y un consuelo: no podemos llegar a todo el mundo, no podemos hacer que todos vengan a misa, no podemos convencer a todo el mundo, estamos lejos de eso. Pero siempre podemos rogar por todos, suplicar, encomendarlos a Dios. Sabemos que nuestra plegaria da frutos, pues Dios nos ha instituido como intercesores para su pueblo.

«Según san Gregorio [san Gregorio Magno, papa y escritor espiritual del siglo VI], antes de ser sacerdote se debe haber adquirido tal familiaridad con Dios que no pueda ser rechazado: de modo que quien es admitido a conversar con Dios y no tiene la experiencia de apaciguarle cuando está irritado, no debe hacerse sacerdote ni ser admitido para ser pastor en la Iglesia, pues una de las principales obligaciones, después de su propia justificación y el amor al prójimo, es aplacar la cólera de Dios y reconciliarle con el mundo»[6].

Es importante, sin embargo, escuchar a la persona a fondo antes de formular un consejo. No hay que darse prisa en emitir un parecer y proporcionar soluciones; hay que evitar dar recetas precocinadas moralizantes que no responden al sufrimiento de la persona. Cuando se da un consejo, hay también que verificar cómo es recibido y comprendido, si es fuente de paz y de ánimo para la persona. Hay que aceptar a veces ser pobre y no tener gran cosa que decir.

los presbíteros que hay entre vosotros, yo —presbítero como ellos y, además, testigo de los padecimientos de Cristo y partícipe de la gloria que va a manifestarse— os exhorto: apacentad la grey de Dios que se os ha confiado, gobernando no a la fuerza, sino de buena gana según Dios; no por mezquino afán de lucro, sino de corazón; no como tiranos sobre la heredad del Señor, sino haciéndoos modelo de la grey[19]. Impresiona notar que en este texto Pedro no define el papel del presbítero en términos de función social, sino a partir de una doble experiencia espiritual: ser testigo de los padecimientos de Cristo y partícipe de la gloria que va a manifestarse. El presbítero no es ante todo la persona que ejerce tal o cual responsabilidad, sino alguien que ha comprendido los sufrimientos de Cristo, que ha percibido la misericordia y el amor infinitos de Dios mostrados en la Pasión, y también alguien que ha captado la belleza del Reino que vendrá, el esplendor de la esperanza que tenemos en Cristo. Todo se refiere, pues, al misterio de Cristo.

Quadrant II is the heart of effective personal management. It deals with things that are not urgent, but are important. It deals with things like building relationships, writing a personal mission statement, long-range planning, exercising, preventive maintenance, preparation—all those things we know we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren’t urgent.

Gofer delegation means “Go for this, go for that, do this, do that, and tell me when it’s done.” Most people who are producers have a gofer delegation paradigm. Remember the machete wielders in the jungle? They are the producers. They roll up their sleeves and get the job done. If they are given a position of supervision or management, they still think like producers. They don’t know how to set up a full delegation so that another person is committed to achieve results. Because they are focused on methods, they become responsible for the results.

The Golden Rule says to “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.” While on the surface that could mean to do for them what you would like to have done for you, I think the more essential meaning is to understand them deeply as individuals, the way you would want to be understood, and then to treat them in terms of that understanding. As one successful parent said about raising children, “Treat them all the same by treating them differently.”

Empathic listening involves much more than registering, reflecting, or even understanding the words that are said. Communications experts estimate, in fact, that only 10 percent of our communication is represented by the words we say. Another 30 percent is represented by our sounds, and 60 percent by our body language. In empathic listening, you listen with your ears, but you also, and more importantly, listen with your eyes and with your heart. You listen for feeling, for meaning. You listen for behavior. You use your right brain as well as your left. You sense, you intuit, you feel.

Although all the recent popes have strongly urged bishops to encourage foreign mission vocations in their diocese, most bishops are too concerned with their own local needs to make more than token efforts in this direction. Often, not only do they not encourage vocations to the field afar, but they actively discourage them. One mission vocation director whom I know refers contemptuously to this attitude on the part of certain bishops and seminary superiors as “spiritual birth control.”5

The objections [of formators] run something like this: “Why run off to Korea or India or Africa when there is such a need for vocations right here at home? The south and the southwest, the rural areas and the slums of every big city are literally crying out for dedicated missionaries.”. . . [But] one of the most baffling paradoxes of Christianity is that in order to fully realize one’s capacity as a child of God, one must surrender freely and joyfully all that he is and has in an interior act of abandon. Christ invites one to lose his life in order to find it; He says that one must renounce home, family and material possessions if one desires the fullness of grace; one must even abandon his will, desires, and care for the future in order to live from day to day in search of the Kingdom of God which is within one. This total renunciation of self is the only door that leads to fulfillment of self.6

“It is easier to believe Jesus Christ present in an immaculate, richly ornate tabernacle”, Father Al would reflect in his book Poverty, “or to believe him present in words written on clean germ-free pages, or again to believe him present in the impressive, solemn Magisterium of the Church, than to believe him present in the unwashed masses of poverty-stricken humanity.” He continued: “It requires faith of the deepest kind, a faith similar to that of the Centurion on Calvary. The Centurion looked up at the crushed figure of Christ upon the cross, a figure in whom there was neither beauty nor comeliness, and said: ‘Indeed, this was the son of God.’ ”

“Capax Dei” (“capable of God”) is a description of man in his most sublime dimension. Poor little finite creature though he be, man is still able to be filled with God as a glass with wine or a room with sunlight. Man has within himself the capacity to become a child of God and to share fully in the divine life. . . . Granted that people who are hungry are not as receptive as people who are well-fed; nevertheless, they are capable both of hearing the Word of God and also of accepting in their heart. One would be doing the poor an injustice by stating dogmatically that they are incapable of learning about God, praying, or grasping, in some manner at least, the eternal truths of salvation.16

In the psalms, the Holy Spirit says, and He is quoting God, “I dwell in a place which is dry and waterless.” God dwells in the desert; He dwells in nothingness, emptiness, extreme poverty. If you want to find God, renounce all your possessions and seek God. Jesus died poor on the cross. He is stripped naked. He has no good reputation. He gives His mother. He is alone. His disciples have left Him, and He has no friends. The blood leaves His body—health and strength and life leave his body. . . . He empties Himself completely and the figure of Jesus on the cross is that of total, absolute, terrible, frightening poverty. Jesus says, “If you wish to be my disciple, you must renounce all that you possess.” All means visible possessions and invisible possessions. What is on the outside, what is on the inside—all.

“There is so much to do over here, so few to do it, and so little to do it with, that at times one is tempted to become discouraged”, Father Al reflected. “Still, one takes solace in the thought that God helps people one at a time, as individuals. . . . Our family-unit orphanage program will not take care of all the tens of thousands of orphans in Korea. But it will help a significant few, and this is what counts.

[The motherhouse], although strong and adequate, is quite simple and completely devoid of bell towers, verandas, and other architectural gingerbread. . . . The convent serves as a sign and a witness to poverty and humility not only to outsiders but, more important, to candidates entering the community as well. To a great extent, one’s surroundings condition one’s thinking. As Frank Lloyd Wright once put it: “First you form the building, then the building forms you.” In the same line of reasoning, it is difficult to think poor while one is living rich and while one is psychologically identified with a convent which appears prestigious and imposing. The fact that the Mariahwe candidates live in a building of utmost simplicity facilitates a deeper penetration of the Christian ideal of poverty and service.4

Our God is a God of silence. He dwells in silence. When Jesus seeks the Father, He goes into the desert. . . . If we wish to serve really as children of God, we have to have a certain love of silence, a certain love of hiddenness, and a desire to serve without recognition, without noise, and without blowing your trumpet. . . . Many works of service of charity have failed. As I mentioned before, frequently, this serious lack is the fear of the cross, and fleeing from the cross. People want to serve without any suffering, pain, difficulty, or discomfort. This is not Christlike service. This type of service is not of value. . . . In order to serve the poor in a Christlike manner, in the name of Christ, we have to courageously renounce the praise, glory, recognition, and thanks of men. This requires courage. This requires sacrifice. This goes against our human nature. . . .

Our role, in a sense, is to cast the devil out of the children entrusted to us, the sick and the poor, and to fill them with the grace and life of God. This is to be done only by prayer accompanied by tears—[the tears of] prayer and sacrifice. The two go together—prayer and sacrifice—as flesh and blood. If you have flesh but no blood, you are pale, anemic, lifeless, weak and without vitality. Prayer without sacrifice is like flesh without blood. It is weak, anemic—ineffective. . .

We come to serve the poor with the mind, the heart, the spirit of Christ—to serve the poor as He served the poor. We just realize that Christ served the poor especially spiritually. This was his focus, his thrust. His thirst was the soul rather than the body. It was eternity rather than time. It was the next world rather than this world. . . . He says, “I have come that my lambs might have life and that they might have it in abundance.” These lambs, these sheep of Jesus are especially the poor, the lowly, the weak, the suffering. He comes to give them abundant life.6

The first thing I did for the kids was to give them a bath, one by one, and change them into fresh clothes. I hand-washed dirty clothes and sanitized the room to make it clean and safe. In winter, I was drenched with sweat even though it was cold. . . . Except for Mass and hourly liturgy times, my eyes were fixed to the kids all day long: feeding, cleaning rooms, brushing their teeth, changing diapers, and washing them all day long. To maintain their health, I walked the grounds with them. We were like a family. By that time, I was able to communicate with them eye-to-eye, heart-to-heart.

At times my poor head feels like a volcano ready to explode and spew out a thousand problems, plans, worries, concerns, and cares. But underneath the volcano flows a river of peace, which keeps my head cool, light, and full of peace. With St. Paul, I like to say: “I am the slave of Christ”. I ask him to remove from my breast my own freedom which I thoroughly distrust, and in its place to put his Spirit, His Will, His Heart, His glorious freedom. . . . Can I handle all this? No, not really. But I entrust all these plans and projects to the Virgin of the Poor. If it is for the glory of God, she will handle it quite well. The Virgin of the Poor, no matter how much money I use, continues to send me more. I feel that this is an indication that I should continue to expand. So many risks are involved, but I think we should try. Also, I feel a sense of urgency. We are fighting for immortal souls. The devil does not sit still. He goes about like a roaring lion. I think we must move faster and roar even more loudly, if we wish to defeat him. My health is never very good. Nothing comes easy. Every day is a struggle.9

I am not afraid of making decisions and moving ahead. But I distrust myself and my own judgment, and I am deathly afraid of making decisions that are not in accordance with the will of my Father. It is such a precious grace to discern, discover, and decide what is His eternal, holy, and fruitful Will. This grace is so precious that it is not lightly given. One must be willing to enter the darkness, press his face to the earth, sweat and bleed and agonize. Then in good time, an angel comes and gives the necessary light.

Occasionally during Mass, flies get into the act and add to the excitement. They play games by landing on my nose, then my forehead, and occasionally my ears or the back of my hands. I wonder if Jesus had a similar form of torture on Calvary. None of the Gospel writers speak of the role of the flies in the Passion of the Christ. But it was hot, it was the middle of the afternoon and there were a lot of people milling about drinking and probably eating. So I imagine there were many flies around also and that some of them added to the torment of the Savior.13

Jesus’s role on the cross was to pray and to suffer. He offers to the Father His sacrifice of praise, His prayer together with His terrible pain, with His blood. On the cross, He does not preach. He does not teach. He hardly speaks. On the cross, He performs no miracles. He does not heal. He does not visibly help. He does not plan or organize or do anything productive. Yet, on the cross, by His prayer and suffering, Jesus accomplishes the greatest work in the history of mankind. He redeems the world. He sanctifies man. He obtains salvation for us and nothing more noble, exalted, or holy can be imagined.

And this, I think, will be of more benefit to my children, my sisters, [and] my brothers than all of my planning and projects and programs. This is the supreme test and ultimate act of faith and love. . . . I am nailed to the cross of ALS. Each day the struggle intensifies. The disease is inexorable in its progress. Each day becomes more difficult than the day before, and looking ahead, I see stretching before me uncharted paths of pain, suffering, and humiliation. Being a realist, I am trying to find out how to cope. . . . The answer is found on Calvary in the person of Jesus. I must aspire to his heroism. . . . I believe He has sent me ALS as a sign of His love and special favor. I believe this and I try to renew this belief at each instant. So it is, I do not look at ALS as an enemy which I fight. I accept it, embrace it, and welcome it as a friend. . . . I believe God gives me this pain and suffering. I believe at the same time he gives me the strength and grace to accept it, endure it, and cope with it. Jesus says to St. Paul, “My grace is sufficient for you, my strength is made perfect in your weakness.” I believe the grace of Jesus will always be adequate. The problem is, I would like it to be more adequate. But it is enough, just enough, for that moment and that instant. As Jesus on the cross, I do not look back. I do not consider the future but I trust in God. I believe in His grace from instant to instant.

believe that suffering is redemptive, pain is salvific, and death and humiliation are fruitful and productive. St. Paul writes, “Without the shedding of blood, there is no work of salvation.” And in a similar manner, Jesus in the Gospel says, “Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. If it dies, it bears fruit.” So, I believe this suffering, humiliation, or pain I endure is purposeful, is fruitful and productive. The blood of Jesus is not enough to redeem the world. He loves us so much, He wants us to participate in the greatest, most satisfying, and fulfilling work imaginable—which is the saving of souls.

The enemy will place obstacles, will portray the effort to grow as too difficult, unsustainable, and destined to fail. Father Tom hears precisely these intimations in his heart: “How long do you think these spiritual efforts will last? How long have they ever lasted in the past? What makes you think it’s going to be different this time? Why get your hopes up just to see it all fall apart? You know you can’t sustain this.” Obstacles, obstacles, obstacles… and the message, “It’s too difficult. You can’t sustain this.”

Finally, Ignatius says, the enemy will attempt to disquiet with false reasons, to bring discouraging considerations that trouble the person. Father Tom also undergoes this tactic of the enemy: “You’ve been getting compliments… You like people to see you praying before the Blessed Sacrament… You’re in competition with the other priests… These efforts may be a little about God, but they are mostly about you.” No! None of these motivations was remotely present in the retreat and in the following months. Father Tom has truly experienced God’s grace, and genuine spiritual growth is occurring.

This is what I notice: When I’m discouraged, it seems that the first thing to be attacked is my usual spiritual practices for the day. At those times, I find myself thinking of changing them. As far as I can see, these changes are never good. I know, for example, how this one goes: If I do pray Evening Prayer later, it will be quickly and basically to get it done. Or I may never pray it. If I pray Evening Prayer before supper according to my custom, I appreciate it more and find it more fruitful.”

A scriptural verse came to mind, “Behold, I am with you always” (Mt 28:20). “Always.” As Father Tom sat by the water, his heart in peace, that word acquired new meaning: always, even—perhaps especially—in the dark, disheartening times. A thought followed: “In times of desolation, it would be good to remember this verse, perhaps even to say it out loud and more than once. This could help me assimilate its truth and hear the Lord tell me that I am not alone in the desolation.”

Be aware. Live the reflective spiritual and priestly life. Do not simply be carried along by busyness, pressures, and any spiritual winds that flow through your heart and mind. Be aware! Understand. Use the tools—Ignatius has offered so many—to perceive what is of God and what is not of God in the impulses, attractions, resistances, desires, and thoughts that you experience in daily life. Take action. Do not be passive! Act. Accept what is of God, and pursue it in your priestly life. Reject what is of the enemy, so that it can never harm you.

The sacramental principle works so well because it presupposes the fundamental reality of human nature: we are composed of body and soul, a material body and a spiritual soul. What we do to one component profoundly affects the other. What we do with our body, our senses, provides the foundation for our spiritual growth. Grace builds on nature.

Fear is, in principle, a primary defense mechanism, but it can become our number one enemy and upset our perception of life. Titus Livius put it well when he considered the matter: “Fear always disposes us to see things as worse than they are.”

If a person lives in a constant state of high alert, it produces an interpretation of reality that makes it seem worse than it is. Your internal responses to events treat them like real threats. The brain’s responses become confused.

Happiness doesn’t lie in what happens to us, but in how we interpret what happens to us. It depends on the way we assimilate reality; our capacity to orient or focus that assimilation is key to our ability to be happy.

Harmful emotions are caused by thoughts, whether conscious or not. And thoughts can be learned or reeducated. To successfully become a happy person, fulfilled and at peace, you must work on the way you think. If you do, you’ll be surprised by the results. You change your reality when you change the way you think!

“Repent, and believe in the gospel” (Mk 1:15): these words that introduce the Lenten season, the journey toward Easter in the joyous hope of sharing in the glory of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus, can indeed set us suitably on the path of Christian life, of which Lent is, so to speak, an intensification. Conversion is, in fact, a lifelong task. To convert is to turn away from the futile, toxic things that hold us prisoner so as to turn toward God; but what must we turn away from, and where is God waiting for us? Scripture gives us the answer when it tells us how God led His Chosen People out of servitude so as to bring them into the Promised Land.

When God, moved by compassion, decided to snatch His people away from the violence of slavery and from misery by leading them out of Egypt, it was not to make their life comfortable and carefree but to bring them into the desert, so that they might experience poverty there: austerity, renunciation, solitude, silence, the struggle against self and against Satan, who enslaves us to the world and to money. We learn to be attentive to God precisely in poverty, austerity, and silence because there we discover that we need Him.

When God, moved by compassion, decided to snatch His people away from the violence of slavery and from misery by leading them out of Egypt, it was not to make their life comfortable and carefree but to bring them into the desert, so that they might experience poverty there: austerity, renunciation, solitude, silence, the struggle against self and against Satan, who enslaves us to the world and to money. We learn to be attentive to God precisely in poverty, austerity, and silence because there we discover that we need Him. The desert hollows out emptiness, thirst, and silence in man and thus prepares him to listen to God and His law. The desert is this extraordinary place, far from the dizzying onslaught of communication and the news media, where one can experience a deep, mystical encounter with God that transforms and transfigures.1

As Blessed Marie-Eugène of the Child Jesus noted: The desert removes the multitude of sensory and emotional satisfactions that sully the soul and the many impressions that blind and fetter it. Its bareness makes us poor and detached. Its silence isolates us from the outside world, leaves the soul only with the uniformity of nature’s cycles and the regularity of the life that it has marked out for itself, and thus obliges the soul to enter into this interior world that she came to seek. This bareness and this silence are by no means emptiness, but rather purity, virginity, and simplicity. The desert reveals to the soul that it has managed to calm this reflection of Transcendence, this immaterial ray of divine simplicity that it bears within itself, this luminous trace of the One Who passes through it in haste and remains present in it by His action. The desert is full of God; its immensity and simplicity reveal Him; its silence yields Him. Students of the history of nations have correctly noted that the desert is monotheistic and that it safeguards its inhabitants from the multiplicity of idols. This important observation proves that the desert, too, reveals its own soul, the one transcendent Being Who animates it, to those who allow themselves to be enveloped by it and give it their souls.

In the Bible, this arid place is also the space where it is granted to us to experience divine fidelity, the tenderness of God’s benevolent providence, which watches over us and protects us. Like an eagle that watches over its nest and soars above its little ones, God unfolds His wings and takes us with Him (Deut 32:10–13).

When we are in the midst of temptations, when we learn, like Elijah, that we are no better than our fathers (1 Kings 19:4) and we feel crushed by the weight of our sins and our many infidelities; when we are discouraged, at the end of our strength in our painful, difficult march toward sanctity; when our efforts at conversion and our struggle to be conformed to Christ seem sterile and do not change our human and spiritual mediocrity at all, what are we to do? Where should we seek help? Like Elijah, we must set out through the desert to reach the mountain of the covenant that we have trampled on. In order to safeguard this covenant and reestablish the purity of the faith, Elijah “walked . . . forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God” (1 Kings

The prophets, particularly Elijah and John the Baptist, filled with a jealous zeal for God, lead us by the strength of their faith and the fire of their love in this long march toward the source of our life, our fidelity, and our true identity. It is necessary to advance because life that does not develop dies. To advance is to make progress in holiness; to remain immobile or to go back is to stifle the normal development of the Christian life.

“baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit”: The choice of the word “in the name of the Father” in the Greek text is very important: the Lord says “eis” and not “en”, that is, not “in the name” of the Trinity — as when we say that a vice-prefect speaks “on behalf” of the prefect, an ambassador speaks “on behalf” of the government: no. It says: “eis to onoma”, that is, an immersion in the name of the Trinity, a being inserted in the name of the Trinity, an interpenetration of being in God and of our being, a being immersed in God the Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit; just as it is in marriage, for example. Two people become one flesh, they become a new and unique reality with a new and unique name. [Rom 6:4–7]

This baptism of Jesus teaches us that God, through the sacrament of Baptism that His disciples receive, means to prolong the Incarnation of His beloved Son in each one of them. Through Baptism, indeed, God, our Father, has taken possession of our lives, has incorporated us into Christ’s life, and has sent us the Holy Spirit. “[God] saved us . . . by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit, which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal life” (Tit 3:5–7).

This ability to receive God’s very own life is inscribed in our nature, although accomplishing it is not within our grasp. And when a human becomes aware that he is made to see God, and understands at the same time that this is impossible for him because of the infinite distance between the creature and the Creator, a sense of the absurdity of life takes hold of him and discourages him from seeking God. But look: the Incarnation comes, and hope is reborn: the fact that the Word of God willed to take human nature into the unity of His Person shows very clearly that man can be united

To receive Baptism is not only a joyous, liberating event: it is also a serious decision, accompanied by a heavy responsibility to take up, with the help of divine grace, the challenge of living according to the faith in the middle of a world that is hostile to God and the gospel. Ultimately it means accepting the Cross, suffering, and death for the name of Jesus, so as to rise again with Him.

Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist have no meaning unless they lead to an intimate union with the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ. To be listed in the parish registers, to bear the name of Christian without living out one’s Baptism, to participate in liturgical rites without making them an active part of one’s life, to remain aloof from personal contact with Jesus is not to enter into a true friendship with God; it is to make our Christianity vain and sterile.
